Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau

This bill prohibits race and sex stereotyping in instruction provided to students in University of Wisconsin System institutions and Technical College System technical colleges and in training provided to employees of the University of Wisconsin System and technical colleges.

Under the bill, the institutions and technical colleges shall not allow instruction to students that promotes race or sex stereotyping in any course or as part of any curriculum and shall not require an employee to attend a training that teaches, advocates, acts upon, or promotes race or sex stereotyping.  Among the concepts that are prohibited to be taught under the bill are the following:  that one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex and that an individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, bears responsibility for acts committed in the past by other individuals of the same race or sex.  The institutions and technical colleges must post all course syllabuses, including updates to the syllabuses, on their websites.

The bill provides that the Board of Regents of the UW System and the Technical College System Board shall withhold from a violating institution or technical college 10 percent of certain state aid that would have otherwise been allocated to that institution or technical college.  The bill also allows a student or employee of an institution or technical college to issue a complaint to the Board of Regents or the Technical College System Board regarding an alleged violation of the bill, and to file a civil action seeking declaratory or injunctive relief regarding an alleged violation of the bill.  If the student or employee is successful in the civil action, the court shall award the student or employee attorney fees.
