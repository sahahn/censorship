teaching standards used to implement instruction in (i) local school administrative units, (ii)

in June 2007, as applied to diverse political viewpoints. The State Board of Education shall report
on compliance with this section to the Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee no later
than November 15, 2021. Any rules adopted or policies implemented in compliance with this
section shall go in effect on or before January 1, 2022.
