mandatory gender or sexual diversity training or counseling. Any orientation or

race or sex is prohibited.
(2) This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit voluntary counseling.
3. (1) No teacher, administrator, or other employee of a school district or public
school shall require or make part of a course the concept that:

(b) An individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, is inherently racist,
sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously;
(c) An individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment
solely or partly because of the individual's race or sex;

(e) An individual's moral character is necessarily determined by the individual's
race or sex;
(f) An individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, bears responsibility
for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex;
(g) An individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of
psychological distress on account of the individual's race or sex; or
(h) Meritocracy or traits such as a strong work ethic are racist or sexist or were
created by members of a particular race to oppress members of another race.
(2) This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the teaching of concepts
that align with the academic performance standards, learning standards, or the
statewide assessment system as established under chapter 160.
4. If an individual holding a certificate of license to teach granted under chapter
168 violates this section, the state board of education shall begin discipline proceedings
against such individual under section 168.071.
5. (1) If the state board of education determines that a publicly funded local
education agency or online program of instruction has violated this section, the board
shall notify the entity of its violation.
(2) If such entity fails to comply with this section within thirty days of such
notification, the state board of education shall direct the department of elementary and
secondary education to withhold a maximum of ten percent of the monthly distribution
of state formula funding to such entity. After the board determines that such entity is in
compliance with this section, the department shall restore the distribution of the funding
to its original amount before the percentage of the distribution was withheld.
6. The state board of education may promulgate all necessary rules and
regulations for the administration of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that
term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this
section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter
536 are nonseverable, and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul
a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority
and any rule proposed or adopted after the effective date of this section shall be invalid
and void.
Section B. Because immediate action is necessary to prohibit discrimination in
2 education, section A of this act is deemed necessary for the immediate preservation of the

3 public health, welfare, peace, and safety, and is hereby declared to be an emergency act within
4 the meaning of the constitution, and section A of this act shall be in full force and effect upon
5 its passage and approval.
