(e) An individual's moral character is necessarily determined by the individual's
race or sex;
(f) An individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, bears responsibility
for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex;
(g) An individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of
psychological distress on account of the individual's race or sex; or
(h) Meritocracy or traits such as a strong work ethic are racist or sexist or were

that align with the academic performance standards, learning standards, or the
statewide assessment system as established in chapter 160.
4. The state board of education may promulgate all necessary rules and
regulations for the administration of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that
term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this
section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter
536 are nonseverable, and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul
a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority
and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2022, shall be invalid and void.
173.2171. 1. As used in this section, "institution of higher education" means any
approved public institution as defined in section 173.1102.
2. (1) No enrolled student of an institution of higher education shall be required
to engage in any form of mandatory gender or sexual diversity training or counseling.
Any orientation or requirement that presents any form of race or sex stereotyping or a
bias on the basis of race or sex is prohibited.
(2) This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit voluntary counseling.
3. No employee of an institution of higher education shall require or make part
of a course the concept that:
(1) One race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex;
(2) An individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, is inherently racist,
sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously;
(3) An individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment
solely or partly because of the individual's race or sex;
(4) Members of one race or sex can not and should not attempt to treat others
without respect to race or sex;

rules and regulations for the administration of this section. Any rule or portion of a
rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority
delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to

and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2022, shall be invalid and void.
Section B. Because immediate action is necessary to prohibit discrimination in
education, section A of this act is deemed necessary for the immediate preservation of the
public health, welfare, peace, and safety, and is hereby declared to be an emergency act within
the meaning of the constitution, and section A of this act shall be in full force and effect upon
its passage and approval.
