sexuality unless the parent or the adult or emancipated student
subsequently opts out of the instruction for the student.

to:
(1) collect or share information of a personal analysis,
evaluation, or survey under subsection (b); or
(2) provide software or software tools that can be used for
data collection, analysis, or evaluation of a student;
the terms of the contract or agreement must be available for
inspection on the department's, school corporation's, or school's
Internet web site. A school corporation, school, or the department
may not authorize a third party vendor to act in the same capacity
as a school official for purposes of collecting a student's personal
identifiable information. Any contract or agreement entered into
under this section with a third party vendor shall include data
privacy and protection requirements to protect student
information including that any information collected by the third
party vendor is subject to 20 U.S.C. 1232h (protection of pupil
