race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating.
As used in this section:

2.

“Race or sex scapegoating” means assigning fault, blame or

bias to a race or sex, or to members of a race or sex because of his
or her race or sex.

It similarly encompasses any claim that,

consciously or unconsciously, and by virtue of his or her race or
sex, members of any race are inherently racist or are inherently
inclined to oppress others, or that members of a sex are inherently
sexist or inclined to oppress others.
Nothing in this section prevents agencies or departments of the
this state from promoting racial, cultural or ethnic diversity or
inclusiveness; provided, such efforts are consistent with the
requirements of this section.
SECTION 2.

Req. No. 253

This act shall become effective November 1, 2021.
