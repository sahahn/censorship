(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)

 


Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring:

1. Short title

This act may be cited as the "Stop Critical Race Theory and Racial Discrimination in Schools and Other Public Institutions Act".

2. Purpose

The people of this state find and declare the following:

1. Slavery, legal racial discrimination and racism are so inconsistent with the founding principles of the United States that Americans fought a civil war to eliminate the first, waged long-standing political campaigns to eradicate the second and have made the third unacceptable in the court of public opinion.

2. Racially discriminatory ideologies and practices such as that known as "critical race theory" directly contradict the principles of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Constitution of Arizona by inflaming divisions on the basis of race and ethnicity.

3. By advocating for differential treatment of individuals on the basis of race and ethnicity, promoting the assumption that reverse racism is necessary or advancing the idea that an individual should be first and foremost reduced to one's demographic identity, the aforementioned ideologies and practices deny the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law and the promise of the Declaration of Independence holding that all men are created equal.

4. The ordinary meaning of terms such as "anti-racist" and "diversity, equity and inclusion" have been supplanted and distorted by proponents of an ideology that actively groups, segregates, discriminates or otherwise advocates for differential treatment among individuals based on racial and ethnic characteristics.

5. It is unacceptable for state-run, taxpayer-supported institutions to teach or implement racially discriminatory ideologies or practices or to require students or employees to endorse racial discrimination or participate in activities promoting it.

3. Article II, section 36, Constitution of Arizona, is proposed to be amended as follows if approved by the voters and on proclamation of the Governor:

36. Preferential treatment or discrimination prohibited; exceptions; definitions
