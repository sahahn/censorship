section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall
become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter
536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable,
and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to
review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or
adopted after August 28, 2022, shall be invalid and void.

the United States, and in the electoral process. A local school district maintaining such a high
school shall require that prior to the completion of the twelfth grade each pupil who receives a
high school diploma or certificate of graduation on or after January 1, 1994, shall
satisfactorily complete such a course of study. Such course shall be of at least one semester in
length and may be two semesters in length. The department of elementary and secondary
education may provide assistance in developing such a course if the district requests

the institutions, branches, and functions of state government, including local governments,
and of the government of the United States, and in the electoral process.

the state of Missouri, and in American history, American institutions, and American civics. A
school district may elect to waive the requirements of this subsection for any student who
transfers from outside the state to a Missouri high school if the student can furnish
documentation deemed acceptable by the school district of the student's successful
completion in any year from the ninth through the twelfth grade of a course of instruction
in the institutions, branches, and functions of state government, including local governments,
and of the government of the United States, and in the electoral process. A student of a
college or university, who, after having completed a course of instruction prescribed in this
section and successfully passed an examination on the United States Constitution, and in
American history and American institutions required hereby, transfers to another college or
university, is not required to complete another such course or pass another such examination
as a condition precedent to his graduation from the college or university.

maintaining a high school may annually nominate to the state board of education a student
who has demonstrated knowledge of the principles of government and citizenship through

community. Annually, the state board of education shall select fifteen students from those
nominated by the local school districts and shall recognize and award them for their academic
achievement, participation and service.
