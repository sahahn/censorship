section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall
become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter
536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable,
and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to
review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or
adopted after August 28, 2022, shall be invalid and void.

and of the state of Missouri and in American history and American literature so students
gain an understanding of our government institutions shall be given in all public and
private schools in the state of Missouri, except proprietary schools, and shall begin not later

States. In the 1990-91 school year and each year thereafter, local school districts maintaining
high schools shall comply with the provisions of this section by offering in grade nine, ten,
eleven, or twelve a course of instruction in the institutions, branches and functions of the
government of the state of Missouri, including local governments, and of the government of
the United States, and in the electoral process. A local school district maintaining such a high
school shall require that prior to the completion of the twelfth grade each pupil who receives a
high school diploma or certificate of graduation on or after January 1, 1994, shall
satisfactorily complete such a course of study. Such course shall be of at least one semester in
length and may be two semesters in length. The department of elementary and secondary
education may provide assistance in developing such a course if the district requests
assistance. A school district may elect to waive the requirements of this subsection for any
student who transfers from outside the state to a Missouri high school if the student can
furnish documentation deemed acceptable by the school district of the student's successful
completion in any year from the ninth through the twelfth grade of a course of instruction in
the institutions, branches, and functions of state government, including local governments,
and of the government of the United States, and in the electoral process.

other than private trade schools unless [he or she] such pupil has satisfactorily passed an
examination on the provisions and principles of the Constitution of the United States and of
the state of Missouri, and in American history, American institutions, and American civics. A
school district may elect to waive the requirements of this subsection for any student who
transfers from outside the state to a Missouri high school if the student can furnish
documentation deemed acceptable by the school district of the student's successful
completion in any year from the ninth through the twelfth grade of a course of instruction
in the institutions, branches, and functions of state government, including local governments,
and of the government of the United States, and in the electoral process. A student of a
college or university, who, after having completed a course of instruction prescribed in this
section and successfully passed an examination on the United States Constitution, and in
American history and American institutions required hereby, transfers to another college or
university, is not required to complete another such course or pass another such examination
as a condition precedent to his graduation from the college or university.
4. In the 1990-91 school year and each year thereafter, each school district
maintaining a high school may annually nominate to the state board of education a student
who has demonstrated knowledge of the principles of government and citizenship through
academic achievement, participation in extracurricular activities, and service to the
community. Annually, the state board of education shall select fifteen students from those
nominated by the local school districts and shall recognize and award them for their academic
achievement, participation and service.

who are enrolled in public or private high schools in Missouri, if such students are foreign
exchange students sponsored by a national organization recognized by the department of
elementary and secondary education.
