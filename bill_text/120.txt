2021 Senate BILL 411

June 10, 2021 - Introduced by Senators Jacque,  Darling and Nass, cosponsored by Representatives Wichgers, Ramthun, Allen, Behnke, Brandtjen, Dittrich, Gundrum, Horlacher, Knodl, Kuglitsch, Murphy, Neylon, Rozar, Sortwell, Armstrong and Tusler. Referred to Committee on Education.

SB411,1,5 1An Act to amend 118.57 (title) and 119.04 (1); and to create 118.018, 118.40 (2r) 2(b) 2. m., 118.40 (2r) (d) 3., 118.40 (2x) (b) 2. m., 118.40 (2x) (d) 3. and 118.57 (1m) 3of the statutes; relating to: anti-racism and anti-sexism pupil instruction and 4anti-racism and anti-sexism training for employees of school districts and 5independent charter schools.

Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau

This bill prohibits race or sex stereotyping in 1) instruction provided to pupils in school districts and independent charter schools; and 2) training provided to employees of school boards and independent charter schools.  Under the bill, a school board or the operator of an independent charter school is prohibited from allowing a teacher to teach pupils race or sex stereotyping in any course or as part of any curriculum and is prohibited from requiring an employee to attend a training that teaches, advocates, acts upon, or promotes race or sex stereotyping.  Among the concepts that are prohibited from being taught under the bill are the following: that one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex and that an individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, bears responsibility for acts committed in the past by other individuals of the same race or sex.  The bill provides that the state superintendent of public instruction must withhold 10 percent of state aid distributions from a school board or operator that violates these prohibitions.  The bill also provides that a parent or guardian of a student may bring a claim against a school district or operator of a charter school for violation of the prohibitions.

The bill also requires each school board to post all curricula used in schools in the school district on the school district's Internet site and, if a school board maintains an Internet site for an individual school, on the individual school's Internet site.  If an Internet site is maintained for an independent charter school, the bill requires the authorizer of the independent charter school to ensure that all curricula used in the independent charter school are posted on the independent charter school's Internet site.  Under the bill, upon request, a school board or independent charter school operator must provide a printed copy of any curriculum that it is required to post on its Internet site, at no cost to the requester.

For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.

The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:
