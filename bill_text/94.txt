Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina:

SECTION    1.    Article 1, Chapter 29, Title 59 of the 1976 Code is amended by adding:

"Section 59-29-12.    (A)(1)    It is the intent of the General Assembly that educators, administrators, students, childcare providers, employers, and employees:

(a)    respect the dignity of individuals;

(b)    refrain from judging, stereotyping, or scapegoating others based on personal or group characteristics or political and religious beliefs;

(c)    acknowledge the right of others to express differing opinions; and

(d)    foster and defend intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry, and instruction.

(2)    The General Assembly hereby affirms that under the principles enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, United States Constitution, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Constitution of South Carolina, 1895, and Human Affairs Law found in Chapter 13, Title 1, all individuals in places of learning, employment, and childcare have:

(a)    a right to be treated equally as individuals, without being the subjects of, or being compelled to affirm or participate in, stereotyping or scapegoating others based on personal or group characteristics or beliefs; and

(b)    in a learning environment, whether as a child or adult, a right to:

(i)        be presented with instruction that is intellectually honest, placed in historical context, and grounded in verifiable facts;

(ii)    have freedom to express differing opinions, especially on controversial topics, without penalty or marginalization; and

(iii)    have freedom of inquiry, freedom of speech, freedom from compelled speech, and freedom of association.

(B)    For purposes of this section:

(1)    'Place of learning' means a public or private elementary, middle, secondary, or postsecondary school in this State.

(C)    In accordance with subsection (A), the following discriminatory concepts are inherently discriminatory and violate the rights of individuals in a free and egalitarian society enumerated in subsection (A)(2):

(1)    one race or sex is inherently superior or inferior to another race or sex;

(2)    a group or an individual, by virtue of his or her race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, heritage, culture, religion, or political belief is inherently racist, sexist, bigoted, ignorant, biased, fragile, oppressive, or contributive to any oppression, whether consciously or unconsciously;

(3)    an individual or group should receive adverse treatment, receive favorable treatment, or be discriminated against solely or partly because of his or her race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, heritage, culture, religion, or political belief;

(4)    members of one race, sex, or ethnicity cannot and should not attempt to treat, relate to, advise, or instruct others without respect to race, sex, ethnicity, or culture, or that individuals should be separated in accordance with race or ethnicity for purposes of employment, instruction, training, living arrangements, or any other activities;

(5)    an individual's moral character, value, or status, whether wholly or partly, is necessarily determined by his or her race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, heritage, culture, religion, or political belief;

(a)    the existence of genders other than male and female and gender fluidity;

(b)    nonbinary pronouns, honorifics, or related speech;

(c)    unconscious or implicit bias; or

(3)    subject individuals to, or require completion of instruction, presentations, discussions, or counseling that affirms or promotes the discriminatory concepts of  subsection (C), regardless of whether the instruction, presentation, discussion, or counseling is part of a lesson, assigned or suggested materials made available in any format or setting, or workplace training conducted on premises, remotely, or by a third party;

(c)    amend its current contracts, subcontracts, and purchase orders with state agencies to include an exhibit with the text of this section and a signed and binding certification that the state-funded entity is in compliance with the provisions of this section. Each state agency shall include such an exhibit of this certification as part of its future state contracts.

(3)    Within thirty days after the effective date of this section, the head of each agency, political subdivision, and public school district in this State shall ensure compliance with the provisions of this section within his agency or jurisdiction and submit a formal statement of compliance to the Attorney General.

(4)    To ensure transparency, within ninety days after the effective date of this section, every state-funded entity that is a place of learning or preschool readily shall make the full list of classes, books, resources, and materials used for instruction available to the public upon request, whether on its website or as a printed document. This information must remain available for each current academic year and the immediately preceding academic year.

(5)    The provisions of this section may not be construed to prohibit or abridge a person's First Amendment rights to the freedom of speech or to the teaching and free exercise of religion."

SECTION    2.    If any section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this act is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid, such holding shall not affect the constitutionality or validity of the remaining portions of this act, the General Assembly hereby declaring that it would have passed this act, and each and every section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, and word thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more other sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases, or words hereof may be declared to be unconstitutional, invalid, or otherwise ineffective.
