PART IB

OPERATION OF STATE GOVERNMENT

SECTION

1.1.      (SDE: Appropriation Transfer Prohibition) The amounts appropriated herein for aid to subdivisions, allocations to school districts, or special line items shall not be transferred and must be expended in accordance with the intent of the appropriation, except that the department may transfer funds that are deducted and retained from a school district's transportation allocation to reimburse the department for the cost of unauthorized mileage.  This transfer must be agreed upon by both the school district and the department.  Those funds may be transferred into the department's school bus transportation operating account.       1.2.      (SDE: DHEC - Comprehensive Health Assessment)  All school districts shall participate, to the fullest extent possible, in the Medicaid program by seeking appropriate reimbursement for services and administration of health and social services.  Reimbursements to the school districts shall not be used to supplant funds currently being spent on health and social services.       1.3.      (SDE: State Aid to Classrooms)  To the extent possible within available funds, it is the intent of the General Assembly to provide for one hundred percent of full implementation of the Education Finance Act via an allocation from the State Aid to Classrooms appropriation.  The funds appropriated for State Aid to Classrooms shall be allocated as follows: 63.60 percent must be allocated based on the Education Finance Act formula and the differentiated student weightings in this Act; 28.62 percent must be allocated based on the manner of distribution of EFA employer contributions in the prior fiscal year; and 7.79 percent must be allocated to fully implement the State Minimum Teacher Salary Schedule with a minimum starting teacher salary of $36,000.  The department is authorized to adjust the percentage allocation related to EFA employer contributions to accommodate for the disbursement of the state retirement funds and any other related employee allocation sent to districts.  For the current fiscal year, the total pupil count is projected to be 764,037.  These funds represent an average per pupil of $3,887 in State Aid to Classrooms.  The average per pupil funding is projected to be $6,902 state, $1,202 federal, and $7,423 local.  This is an average total funding level of $15,527 excluding revenues of local bond issues.  It is the intent of the General Assembly that the consolidation of the Education Finance Act and Education Finance Act - Employer Contributions appropriations, and the subsequent allocation of the State Aid to Classrooms appropriation back to these categories, should not significantly alter the application of funding formulas or maintenance of effort requirements referencing the Education Finance Act and Education Finance Act - Employer Contributions.        The funds allocated from State Aid to Classrooms for implementing the revised State Minimum Teacher Salary Schedule shall be distributed to school districts using the EIA Teacher Salary Supplement methodology.  The resulting estimated teacher salary schedule is as follows:

For the purpose of maintaining consistency when calculating maintenance of effort, references to the base student cost shall be interpreted as the base student cost resulting from the 63.60 percent of funds appropriated for State Aid to Classrooms and allocated for the Education Finance Act and, where appropriate, the 28.62 percent  of State Aid to Classrooms allocated for Education Finance Act Employer Contributions, and other any other items normally included in the base student cost calculation.        For the purpose of maintaining consistency when calculating the Base Student Cost, the base student cost calculation shall include funds from State Aid to Classrooms consisting of the 63.60% of funds appropriated for State Aid to Classrooms allocated based on the Education Finance Act formula and the 7.79% that are allocated to fully implement the State Minimum Teacher Salary Schedule.        For the current fiscal year the South Carolina Public Charter School District and any institution of higher education sponsoring a public charter school shall receive and distribute state EFA funds to the charter school as determined by one hundred percent of the current year's base student cost, as funded by the General Assembly multiplied by the weighted pupils enrolled in the charter school, which must be subject to adjustment for student attendance.       The Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, must post in a prominent place on their website for each school district projections, including the per pupil state, federal and local revenues, excluding revenues of local bond issues, for the current fiscal year.  Also, as soon as practicable, upon determining the exact numbers regarding pupil count and funding, the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, shall also post on their website the one hundred thirty-five day average daily membership for each school district and per pupil state, federal and local revenues, excluding revenues of local bond issues, based on the most recent audited financial statement as reported annually pursuant to Section 59-17-100.  The Department of Education and the Education Oversight Committee shall provide in a prominent place on their internet websites a link to the information posted by the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, including the projected numbers and the exact numbers.        For the current fiscal year, the pupil classification weightings are as follows:              (1)      K-12 pupils or base students including homebound students                  1.00                         Students served in licensed residential treatment facilities (RTFs) for children and adolescents as defined under Section 44-7-130 of the 1976 Code shall receive a weighting of 2.10.              (2)      Weights for students with disabilities as prescribed in Section 59-20-40(1)(c) Special Programs              (3)      Precareer and Career Technology                                                                        1.29              (4)      Additional weights for personalized instruction:                          (A)      Gifted and Talented                                                                                          0.15                          (B)      Academic Assistance                                                                                    0.15                          (C)      Limited English Proficiency                                                                        0.20                          (D)      Pupils in Poverty                                                                                                0.20                          (E)      Dual Credit Enrollment                                                                              0.15        No local match is required for the additional weightings for personalized instruction in the current school year.  Charter school per pupil calculations for locally sponsored charters will continue to be calculated according to Section 59-40-140 of the 1976 Code.  Students may receive multiple weights for personalized instruction; however, within each weight, students should only be counted once.  These weights are defined below:        Students in poverty are students who qualify for Medicaid, SNAP, TANF, or are homeless, transient, or in foster care.        Gifted and talented students are students who are classified as academically or artistically gifted and talented or who are enrolled in Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International courses in high school.  Districts shall set-aside twelve percent of the funds for serving artistically gifted and talented students in grades three through twelve.        Students in need of academic assistance are students who do not meet state standards in mathematics, English language arts, or both on state approved assessments in grades three through eight and high school assessments for grades nine through twelve.  The additional weight generates funds needed to provide additional instructional services to these students.        Students with limited English proficiency are students who require intensive English language instruction programs and whose families require specialized parental involvement intervention.        Funds received by a school district pursuant to the dual credit weighting must be used to defray all possible costs of dual credit courses for students.  Students identified for dual credit enrollment must be identified in PowerSchool as taking a course that will lead to both high school credit and post-secondary credit.  Districts must utilize these funds to offset the cost of tuition, fees, instructors, and instructional materials for qualifying courses with the local technical college or other institution of higher education.  Each school district shall report to the department the number of students participating in dual credit courses and specify the cost borne by each entity.  School districts must assist students in accessing Lottery Tuition Assistance when applicable.        Further, the Department of Education may use school district student counts for personalized instruction as collected in the same manner as the prior fiscal year, PowerSchool or other available existing data sources as determined by the department to calculate the school district add on weightings for the personalized instruction classifications and the determination of the school districts monetary entitlement.  End of year adjustments shall be based on the one hundred thirty-five day student average daily membership for all classifications.  During the current fiscal year, the department will update PowerSchool calculations, reports, screen development, documentation, and training to incorporate the new pupil classification weightings and to make final district allocation adjustments by June 30.  The department must provide districts with technical assistance with regard to student count changes in PowerSchool.        1.4.      (SDE: EFA - Formula)  The amount appropriated in Part IA, Section 1 for "Education Finance Act" shall be the maximum paid under the provisions of Act 163 of 1977 (the South Carolina Education Finance Act of 1977) to the aggregate of all recipients.  The South Carolina Education Department shall develop formulas to determine the state and required local funding as stipulated in the South Carolina Education Finance Act of 1977.  Such formulas shall require the approval of the State Board of Education and the State Fiscal Accountability Authority.  After computing the EFA allocations for all districts, the department shall determine whether any districts' minimum required local revenue exceeds the districts' total EFA Foundation Program.  When such instance is found, the department shall adjust the index of taxpaying ability to reflect a local effort equal to the cost of the districts' EFA Foundation Program.  The districts' weighted pupil units are to be included in determination of the funds needed for implementation of the Education Finance Act statewide.        In the event that the formulas as devised by the Department of Education and approved by the State Board of Education and the State Fiscal Accountability Authority should provide for distribution to the various school districts totaling more than the amount appropriated for such purposes, subject to the provisions of this proviso, the Department of Education shall reduce each school district entitlement by an equal amount per weighted pupil so as to bring the total disbursements into conformity with the total funds appropriated for this purpose.  If a reduction is required in the state's contribution, the required local funding shall be reduced by the proportionate share of local funds per weighted pupil unit.  The Department of Education shall continually monitor the distribution of funds under the provisions of the Education Finance Act and shall make periodic adjustments to disbursements to ensure the aggregate of such disbursements do not exceed the appropriated funds.        Local districts shall not be mandated or required to inflate the base number in their respective salary schedules by any percentage greater than the percentage by which the appropriated base student cost exceeds the appropriated base student cost of the prior fiscal year.       1.5.      (SDE: Employer Contributions/Allocations)  It is the intent of the General Assembly that the appropriation contained herein for "Public School Employee Benefits" shall not be utilized to provide employer contributions for any portion of a school district employee's salary that is federally funded.        State funds allocated for school district employer contributions must be allocated by the formula and must be used first by each district to cover the cost of fringe benefits for personnel required by the Defined Program, food service personnel and other personnel required by law.  Once a district has expended all state allocated funds for fringe benefits, the district may utilize food service revenues to fund a proportionate share of fringe benefits costs for food service personnel.        The Department of Juvenile Justice and the Department of Corrections' school districts must be allocated funds under the fringe benefits program in accordance with criteria established for all school districts.       1.6.      (SDE: Employer Contributions/Obligations)  In order to finalize each school district's allocations of Employer Contributions funds for retiree insurance from the prior fiscal year, the Department of Education is authorized to adjust a school district's allocation in the current fiscal year accordingly to reflect actual payroll and payments to the Retirement System from the prior fiscal year.  In the event the Department of Education is notified that an educational subdivision has failed to remit proper payments to cover Employee Fringe Benefit obligations, the Department of Education is directed to withhold the educational subdivision's state funds until such obligations are met.       1.7.      (SDE: Governor's School for Science &amp; Math)  Any unexpended balance on June thirtieth of the prior fiscal year of funds appropriated to or generated by the Governor's School for Science and Mathematics may be carried forward and expended in the current fiscal year pursuant to the direction of the board of trustees of the school.       1.8.      (SDE: Educational Responsibility/Foster Care)  The responsibility for providing a free and appropriate public education program for all children including disabled students is vested in the public school district wherein a child of lawful school age resides in a foster home, group home, orphanage, or a state operated health care facility including a facility for treatment of mental illness or chemical dependence and habilitation centers for persons with intellectual disabilities or persons with related conditions located within the jurisdiction of the school district or alternative residences.  The districts concerned may agree upon acceptable local cost reimbursement.  If no agreement is reached, districts providing education shall receive from the district where the child last resided before placement in a facility an additional amount equivalent to the statewide average of the local base student cost multiplied by the appropriate pupil weighting as set forth in Section 59-20-40 of the Education Finance Act.  If a child from out of state is residing in a facility owned and/or operated by a for profit entity, the district providing educational services shall be reimbursed by the for profit entity the local district's local support per weighted pupil above the statewide average base student cost multiplied by the appropriate pupil weighting as set forth in Section 59-20-40 of the Education Finance Act.  Participation will be evidenced by a written agreement from the IEP team or 504 team, written referral, or the school district initiating the placement process.  School districts providing the education shall notify the nonresident district in writing within forty-five calendar days that a student from the nonresident district is receiving education services pursuant to the provisions of the proviso.  The notice shall also contain the student's name, date of birth, and disabling condition if available.  If appropriate financial arrangements cannot be effected between institutions of the state, including independent school districts under the authority of the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs, and school districts, institutions receiving educational appropriations shall pay the local base student cost multiplied by the appropriate pupil weighting.  Children residing in institutions of state agencies shall be educated with nondisabled children in the public school districts if appropriate to their educational needs.  Such institutions shall determine, on an individual basis, which children residing in the institution might be eligible to receive appropriate educational services in a public school setting.  Once these children are identified, the institution shall convene an IEP meeting with officials of the public school district in which the institution is located.  If it is determined by the committee that the least restrictive environment in which to implement the child's IEP is a public school setting, then the school district in which the institution is located must provide the educational services.  However, that school district may enter into contractual agreements with any other school district having schools located within a forty-five mile radius of the institution.  The cost for educating such children shall be allocated in the following manner:  the school district where the child last resided before being placed in an institution shall pay to the school district providing the educational services an amount equivalent to the statewide average of the local base student cost multiplied by the appropriate pupil weighting as set forth in Section 59-20-40 of the Education Finance Act; the school district providing the educational services shall be able to count the child for all funding sources, both state and federal.  The institution and school district, through contractual agreements, will address the special education and related services to be provided to students.  Should the school district wherein the institution is located determine that the child cannot be appropriately served in a public school setting, then the institution may request a due process hearing pursuant to the procedures provided for in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.        The agreed upon acceptable local cost reimbursement or the additional amount equivalent to the statewide average of the local base student cost multiplied by the appropriate pupil weighting set forth in Section 59-20-40, for instructional services provided to out-of-district students, shall be paid within sixty days of billing, provided the billing district has provided a copy of the invoice to both the Superintendent and the finance office of the district being invoiced.  Should the district not pay within sixty days, the billing district can seek relief from the Department of Education.  The department shall withhold EFA funding equal to the billing from the district refusing to pay and submit the funding (equal to the invoice) to the billing school district.        The agency placing a child in any situation that requires changing school districts, must work with the schools to assure that all required school records, including confidential records, are transferred from the sending to the receiving school within three working days.  School records to be transferred should include grade transcripts, state birth certificate, certificate of immunization, social security card, attendance records, discipline records, IEP's, psychological reports (or notation in the school records that a psychological report on the child is available at the school district office) and any other records necessary for the appropriate placement of the child in the new school.  School districts must release all records upon presentation of a court order or appropriate permission for confidential release.  If evaluation or placement is pending, the receiving school district is responsible to secure information and to complete the placement.  The receiving school will maintain appropriate confidentiality of all records received on a child.  Upon discharge or release from the treatment facility, the agency placing the child in the receiving school must work with the school district where the student will reside after treatment to assure continuity of the student's education.       1.9.

For purposes of this proviso, an authorization must be pursuant to a physician's determination of medical necessity.  If clinically appropriate, the facility school district, the RTF, and the parent or guardian of a student referred or placed in a RTF may consider the appropriateness of providing the student's education program virtually through enrollment in either the facility district's virtual program, the South Carolina virtual school program provided through the Department of Education (Virtual SC), or a virtual charter school authorized by the South Carolina Public Charter School District, or a virtual charter school authorized by an approved institute of higher education.

A facility school district is entitled to reimbursement from a resident school district for the difference between (1) the reasonable costs expended for the educational services provided directly by the facility school district or the amount paid to the RTF and (2) the aggregate amount of federal and state funding received by the facility school district for that student.  However, the reimbursement rate may not exceed $90 per student per day.

(SDE: School District Property)  The requirements of Section 59-19-250 of the 1976 Code, as amended, which requires the consent of a governing board of a county in order for school trustees to sell or lease school property whenever they deem it expedient to do so are suspended for the current fiscal year.        1.56.      (SDE: Full-Day 4K) Beginning with the current fiscal year, eligible students residing in any school district may participate in the South Carolina Early Reading Development and Education program (CERDEP) pending the availability of space and funding.  Student eligibility as defined by Section 59-156-130 of the 1976 Code is an annual family income of one hundred eighty-five percent or less of the federal poverty guidelines as promulgated annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services or a statement of Medicaid eligibility.        A parent or guardian may choose to enroll their child in a public school participating in the program and approved by the Department of Education pursuant to Section 59-156-210 or in a private provider participating in the program and approved by the Office of First Steps pursuant to Section 59-156-200.  A private provider includes, but is not limited to, a child care center, a military child care facility regulated by the United States Department of Defense, or a non-profit independent school.  State funds appropriated for the provision of CERDEP services in military child care facilities may not be used to supplant existing federal child care funds.        Beginning with the current fiscal year, 4K programs in public schools and non-profit independent schools participating in CERDEP are not required to be approved, registered, or licensed by the Department of Social Services in order to participate in CERDEP.  Instead, the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps are responsible for ensuring that providers deliver high-quality educational programs pursuant to Section 59-156-160.        Public and private providers shall be funded for instructional costs at a rate of $4,800 per student enrolled.  Eligible students enrolling during the school year or withdrawing during the school year shall be funded on a pro rata basis determined by the length of their enrollment.  Private providers transporting eligible children to and from school shall also be eligible for a reimbursement of $587 per eligible child transported.  All providers who are reimbursed are required to retain records as required by their fiscal agent.  New providers participating for the first time in the current fiscal year and enrolling between one and six eligible children shall be eligible to receive up to $1,000 per child in materials and equipment funding, with providers enrolling seven or more such children eligible for funding not to exceed $10,000.  Providers receiving equipment funding are expected to participate in the program and provide high-quality, center-based programs as defined herein for a minimum of three years.  Failure to participate for three years will require the provider to return a portion of the equipment allocation at a level determined by the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps to School Readiness.  Funding to providers is contingent upon receipt of data as requested by the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps.  The Department of Education shall only provide funding for public school students whose complete records have been entered into PowerSchool based on the one hundred and thirty-five day student average daily membership.  For the current fiscal year, providers may enroll pay-lunch children who score at or below the twenty-fifth national percentile on two of the three DIAL-3 subscales by July 1 if at least seventy-five percent of the total number of children eligible or the Child Early Reading Development and Education Program in a district or county are projected to be enrolled in that program, Head Start, or ABC Child Care Program as determined by the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps, Child Early Reading Development and Education Program.  Providers may receive reimbursement for these children if funds are available.        Annually, the Department of Education is directed to audit the annual allocations to public providers to ensure that allocations are accurate and aligned to the appropriate pro rata per student allocation, materials, and equipment funding.  In the event the department, during the audit process determines that the annual allocations of the prior fiscal year are not accurate, the department must adjust the allocations for the current fiscal year to account for the audit findings.  The department must provide the results of the annual audit findings to the General Assembly no later than December first.  Likewise, in the event the Office of First Steps determines that the annual allocations of the prior fiscal year to private providers are not accurate, the Office of First Steps must adjust the allocations for the current fiscal year to account for the findings.        Of the funds appropriated, $300,000 shall be allocated to the Education Oversight Committee to conduct an annual evaluation of the South Carolina Child Development Education Pilot Program and to issue findings in a report to the General Assembly by January fifteenth of each year.  To aid in this evaluation, the Education Oversight Committee shall determine the data necessary and both public and private providers are required to submit the necessary data as a condition of continued participation in and funding of the program.  This data shall include developmentally appropriate measures of student progress.  Additionally, the Department of Education shall issue a unique student identifier for each child receiving services from a private provider.  The Department of Education shall be responsible for the collection and maintenance of data on the public state funded full day and half-day four-year-old kindergarten programs.  The Office of First Steps to School Readiness shall be responsible for the collection and maintenance of data on the state funded programs provided through private providers.  The Education Oversight Committee shall use this data and all other collected and maintained data necessary to conduct a research based review of the program's implementation and assessment of student success in the early elementary grades along with information, recommendations, and a timeline for how the state can increase the number of students served in high-quality programs.        For each school district that chooses not to participate in CERDEP, the district shall receive the same amount of EIA funds as allocated in the prior fiscal year for the provision of a half-day 4K program from the funds appropriated to the Department of Education for CERDEP or from any funds carried forward from the prior fiscal year to CERDEP.  For eligible children residing in school districts that do not participate in CERDEP, the Department of Education is required to develop and implement inter-district transfer policies that give parents or guardians the option of their eligible child attending an out-of-district school that participates in CERDEP.        For the current fiscal year, the Office of First Steps may expend: (1) up to $2,000,000 to pilot a program to provide higher reimbursement rates to high-quality child care centers.  The reimbursement rate for students enrolled by child care providers rated B or higher in the ABC Quality System operated by the Department of Social Services may be increased by up to 10% of the per-student base following guidelines developed by the Office of First Steps; and (2) up to $100,000 to provide one-time supplemental, needs-based incentive grants in an amount not to exceed $30,000 for newly created and/or newly approved private providers proposing to expand service to ten or more CERDEP eligible children in communities unable to enroll all eligible students in a public, private, or Head Start setting during the prior fiscal year.  These grants are designed to address building renovations, documented as necessary to bring proposed classrooms into compliance with licensing regulations, materials and staffing costs, and/or other obstacles currently preventing their participation in the program.  The First Steps Board of Trustees shall develop and approve an application process that incorporates formal review and fiscal safeguards designed to ensure grant funds are used solely to address documented barriers to program participation.  Providers receiving this one-time supplement shall be expected to participate in the program and provide high-quality, center-based programs as defined herein for a minimum of three years.  Failure to participate for three years shall require the provider to return a portion of the supplemental allocation at a level determined by the Office of First Steps to School Readiness.  First Steps shall submit a report detailing its process, expenditures and expanded enrollment to the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee by March 15; and (3) up to $1,000,000 may be used to provide grants to public-private partnerships to address building renovations and designs necessary to get the building and classrooms into compliance with licensing regulations and other obstacles that prevent participation in CERDEP following guidelines developed by the Office of First Steps.  Providers participating in this pilot shall be expected to participate in the program and provide high-quality, center-based programs as defined herein for a minimum of three years.  Failure to participate for three years shall require the provider to return a portion of the supplemental allocation at a level determined by the Office of First Steps.        If by August first, the Department of Education or the Office of First Steps determines that appropriations will exceed expenditures, available funds may be used to fund an extended program and to increase the length of the program to a maximum of eight and a half hours per day or two hundred and twenty days per year or to fund summer programs.  If a district chooses to fund summer enrollment, the program funding shall conform to the funding in this act for full year programs; however, it shall be reduced on a pro rata basis to conform with the length of the program.  A summer program shall be no more than eight and a half hours per day and shall be not more than ten weeks in length.  The per pupil allocation and classroom grant must conform with the appropriated amount contained in this Act and end of year adjustments shall be based on the one hundred and thirty-five-day student average daily membership or later student average daily membership for districts choosing to extend the program past one hundred and eighty days.  Funds may also be used to provide parent engagement, professional development and quality evaluations of programs.  No later than April first, the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps shall report to the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on the expenditure of these funds to include the following information:  the amount of money used and specific steps and measures taken to enhance the quality of the 4K program and the amount of money used for professional development as well as the types of professional development offered and the number of participants.  The Office of First Steps is directed to determine if the provision of extended programs in private centers improves the ability of parents to enter the workforce or to pursue postsecondary training or industry credentials.        On or before November 15, the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps shall share data that identifies the total number of children enrolled in CERDEP in both public and private providers.  If available appropriations exceed the instructional costs of serving children enrolled in the program and if a waiting list of eligible children can be documented by the Department of Education and by the Office of First Steps, then the Executive Budget Office may authorize the transfer of funds between the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps.        The Office of First Steps and the Department of Education shall collaborate with the South Carolina Head Start State Collaboration Office to inform parents of all publicly funded full-day 4K programs including Head Start.        For Fiscal Year 2021-22, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, children who were eligible to participate in the Child Early Reading Development and Education Program in the prior fiscal year but did not participate, shall be eligible to participate in the program during Fiscal Year 2021-22, subject to classroom availability and funding.        1.57.      (SDE: Summer Reading Camps)  For the current fiscal year, funds appropriated for summer reading camps must be allocated as follows:  (1) up to twenty percent to the Department of Education to provide bus transportation for students attending the camps; (2) $700,000 allocated to the department to provide grants to support community partnerships whereby community organizations shall partner with local school districts to provide enrichment activities as part of after school programs or summer reading camps that utilize volunteers, mentors or tutors to provide instructional support to struggling readers in elementary schools that have a poverty index of forty percent or greater.  All mentors and tutors that are a part of these after school programs or summer reading camps must have passed a SLED criminal background check.  Participant to volunteer or teacher ratio must conform to that of the school district in which the program is located; and (3) the remainder on a per pupil allocation to each school district based on the number of students who substantially failed to demonstrate third-grade reading proficiency as indicated on the prior year's state assessment as defined by Section 59-155-120 (10) of the 1976 Code.  Summer reading camps must be at least six weeks in duration with a minimum of four days of instruction per week and four hours of instruction per day, or the equivalent minimum hours of instruction in the summer.  School transportation shall be provided.  The camps must be taught by compensated teachers who have at least an add-on literacy endorsement or who have documented and demonstrated substantial success in helping students comprehend grade-level texts.  The Department of Education shall assist districts that cannot find qualified teachers to work in the summer camps.  Districts may also choose to contract for the services of qualified instructors or collaborate with one or more districts to provide a summer reading camp.  Schools and school districts are encouraged to partner with county or school libraries, institutions of higher learning, community organizations, faith-based institutions, businesses, pediatric and family practice medical personnel, and other groups to provide volunteers, mentors, tutors, space, or other support to assist with the provision of the summer reading camps.  In the current school year, any student in third grade who substantially fails to demonstrate third-grade reading proficiency by the end of the school year must be offered the opportunity to attend a summer reading camp at no cost to the parent or guardian.  The purpose of the reading camp is to provide students who are significantly below third-grade reading proficiency with the opportunity to receive quality, intensive instructional services and support.  A district may also include in the summer reading camps students who are not exhibiting reading proficiency at any grade and may charge fees for these students to attend the summer reading camps based on a sliding scale pursuant to Section 59-19-90, except where a child is found to be reading below grade level in the first, second or third grade.  A parent or guardian of a student who does not substantially demonstrate proficiency in comprehending texts appropriate for his grade level must make the final decision regarding the student's participation in the summer reading camp.        1.58.      (SDE: Interscholastic Athletic Association Dues)  (A)  A public school district supported by state funds shall not use any funds or permit any school within the district to use any funds to join, affiliate with, pay dues or fees to, or in any way financially support any interscholastic athletic association, body, or entity unless the constitution, rules, or policies of the association, body, or entity contain the following:                    (1)      a range of sanctions that may be applied to a student, coach, team, or program and that takes into account factors such as the seriousness, frequency, and other relevant factors when there is a violation of the constitution, bylaws, rules, or other governing provisions of the association, body, or entity;                    (2)      (a)      guarantees that private or charter schools are afforded the same rights and privileges that are enjoyed by all other members of the association, body, or entity.

The department will create a system of tiers of technical assistance for low-performing schools and districts that will receive technical assistance.  The tiers will be determined by factors that include, but are not limited to, length of time performance of the school or district has been at-risk/below average, annual achievement ratings, annual growth ratings, school or district accreditation, and/or financial risk status.  The tiers of technical assistance may include a per student allocation, placement of a principal mentor, transformation coach, instructional leader, replacement of the principal, reconstitution of a school, and declaration of a state of emergency.  Low-performing schools and districts shall be placed within the tiered technical assistance framework not later than December fifteenth.        Low-performing schools shall receive a diagnostic review through the department.  In addition, newly identified low-performing schools and districts must be reviewed by an External Review Team in the year of designation, and every third year thereafter.

Based upon the recommendations in the review(s), low-performing schools and districts must develop and submit to the Department of Education an updated school renewal or district strategic plan outlining goals for improvements.  The amended plans must address specific strategies designed to increase student achievement and must include measures to evaluate the success of implementation of the plan.        With the funds appropriated to the Department of Education, and any experts placed in the school or district for technical assistance services, the department will assist low-performing schools and districts in designing and implementing the strategies and measurement identified in the amended plans and in brokering for technical assistance personnel as stipulated in the plan.  In addition, the department must monitor student academic achievement and progress on implementation and report their findings to the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the Chairman of the Senate Education Committee, the Chairman of the House Education and Public Works Committee, the local legislative delegation, and the Governor in the fall following the school or district designation as low-performing.

Funds must be used by the department for implementation and delivery of technical assistance services.  Using previous report card data and monitoring reports on the status of implementation of the school renewal plan, the department shall identify priority schools.  Funds appropriated for technical assistance shall be used by the department to work with those schools identified as low-performing and to support priority schools under the tiered system.  These funds shall not be transferred to any other funding category by the school district without prior approval of the State Superintendent of Education and funds are not subject to agency flexibility provisions.        Reconstitution means the redesign or reorganization of the school, which may include the declaration that all positions in the school are considered vacant. Certified staff currently employed in priority schools must undergo an evaluation in the spring following the school's identification as a priority school and must meet determined goals to be rehired and continue their employment at that school.  Educators who were employed at a school that is being reconstituted prior to July 2009, and to whom the employment and dismissal laws apply will not lose their rights in the reconstitution.  If they are not rehired or are not assigned to another school in the school district they have the opportunity for a hearing.  However, employment and dismissal laws shall not apply to educators who are employed in the district and assigned to the priority schools July 1, 2009, in the event of a reconstitution of the school in which the educator is employed.  Those rights are only suspended in the event of a reconstitution of the entire school staff.  Additionally, the rights and requirements of the employment and dismissal laws do not apply to educators who on July 1, 2009, were on an induction or annual contract, that subsequently were offered continuing contract status after the effective date of this proviso, and are employed at a school that is subject to reconstitution under this proviso.        The reconstitution of a school could take place if the school has been identified as a priority school that has failed to improve satisfactorily.  The decision to reconstitute a school shall be made by the State Superintendent of Education in consultation with the principal the school board of trustees, and the district superintendent.  The decision to reconstitute a school shall be made by April first, at which time notice shall be given to all employees of the school.  The department, in consultation with the district superintendent, shall develop a staffing plan and a budget for each reconstituted school.        The State Superintendent of Education may declare a state of emergency in a district if the accreditation status is probation or denied, if a majority of the schools fail to show improvement, if the district is classified as being in "high risk" status financially, or for financial mismanagement resulting in a deficit.  The State Superintendent of Education may declare a state of emergency in a school if the accreditation status is probation or denied, or if the school fails to show improvement.  Upon declaration of a state of emergency, the Superintendent may take over management of the school or district.  Management of the school or district may include direct management, consolidation with another district, charter management, public/private management, or contracting with an educational management organization or another school district.        1A.13.      (SDE-EIA: Proviso Allocations)  In the event an official EIA revenue shortfall is declared by the Board of Economic Advisors, the Department of Education may reduce any allocation in Section 1A specifically designated by proviso in accordance with the lower Board of Economic Advisors revenue estimate as directed by the Executive Budget Office.  No allocation for teacher salaries shall be reduced as a result of this proviso.       1A.14.

However, a school district may not transfer funds allocated specifically for state level maintenance of effort requirements under IDEA, funds allocated specifically for state level maintenance of effort requirement for federal program, funds provided for the Education and Economic Development Act, funds provided for Career and Technology Education, nor funds required for debt service or bonded indebtedness.  All school districts must report the student teacher ratio for every classroom to the Department of Education at the forty-fifth and the one hundred and thirty-fifth day mark.  The department shall report this information to the General Assembly for the 2021-2022 school year.        In order for a school district to take advantage of the flexibility provisions, at least seventy-five percent of the school district's per pupil expenditures must be utilized within the In$ite categories of instruction, instructional support, and only transportation, food service, and safety within non-instruction pupil services.  No portion of the seventy-five percent may be used for facilities, business services, debt service, capital outlay, program management, and leadership services, as defined by In$ite.  The school district shall report to the Department of Education the actual percentage of its per pupil expenditures used for classroom instruction, instructional support, and transportation, food service, and safety within non-instruction pupil services for the current school year ending June thirtieth.  Salaries of on-site principals must be included in the calculation of the district's per pupil expenditures.        "In$ite" means the financial analysis model for education programs utilized by the Department of Education.        School districts are encouraged to reduce expenditures by means, including, but not limited to, limiting the number of low enrollment courses, reducing travel for the staff and the school district's board, reducing and limiting activities requiring dues and memberships, reducing transportation costs for extracurricular and academic competitions, restructuring administrative staffing, and expanding virtual instruction.

For the current fiscal year, savings generated from the suspension of the assessments enumerated above must be allocated to school districts based on weighted pupil units.        School districts must maintain a transaction register that includes a complete record of all funds expended over one hundred dollars, from whatever source, for whatever purpose.  The register must be prominently posted on the district's internet website and made available for public viewing and downloading.  The register must include for each expenditure:              (i)      the transaction amount;              (ii)      the name of the payee; and              (iii)      a statement providing a detailed description of the expenditure.        The register must not include an entry for salary, wages, or other compensation paid to individual employees.  The register must not include any information that can be used to identify an individual employee.  The register must be accompanied by a complete explanation of any codes or acronyms used to identify a payee or an expenditure.  The register must be searchable and updated at least once a month.        Each school district must also maintain on its internet website a copy of each monthly statement for all of the credit cards maintained by the entity, including credit cards issued to its officers or employees for official use.  The credit card number on each statement must be redacted prior to posting on the internet website.  Each credit card statement must be posted not later than the thirtieth day after the first date that any portion of the balance due as shown on the statement is paid.        The Comptroller General must establish and maintain a website to contain the information required by this section from a school district that does not maintain its own internet website.  The internet website must be organized so that the public can differentiate between the school districts and search for the information they are seeking.        The provisions contained herein do not amend, suspend, supersede, replace, revoke, restrict, or otherwise affect Chapter 4, Title 30, of the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act.  Nothing in this proviso shall be interpreted as prohibiting the State Board of Education to exercise its authority to grant waivers under Regulation 43-261.        1A.15.      (SDE-EIA: Teacher Salary Supplement)  The department is directed to carry forward prior year unobligated teacher salary supplement and related employer contribution funds into the current fiscal year to be used for the same purpose.

(SDE-EIA: Certified Staff Technology Proficiency)  To ensure the effective and efficient use of the funding provided by the General Assembly in Part IA, Section 1 VIII.D. for school technology in the classroom and internet access, the State Department of Education shall approve district technology plans that specifically address and incorporate certified staff technology competency standards and local school districts must require certified staff to demonstrate proficiency in these standards as part of each certified staff's Professional Development plan.  District adopted technology proficiency standards and plans should be, at minimum, aligned to the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) teacher standards.  Evidence that districts are meeting the requirement is a prerequisite to expenditure of a district's technology funds.        1A.21.      (SDE-EIA: Accountability Program Implementation)  To support implementation of the accountability program, the Education Oversight Committee may carry forward unexpended Education Accountability Act funds authorized specifically for the administration of the Education Oversight Committee.  For the current fiscal year the Education Oversight Committee may carry forward prior year EIA South Carolina Community Block Grants for Education Pilot Program funds not awarded by the grant committee.  These funds must be used for an independent common evaluation of each awarded grant to ensure high quality programs that maximize a return on the state's investment.        1A.22.      (SDE-EIA: 4K Targeting)  EIA funds allocated for the provision of four-year-old kindergarten shall be utilized for the provision of services to age-eligible children in poverty, as defined in Proviso 1.3 of this Act.  Children with developmental delays documented through state approved screening assessments or children with medically documented disabilities who do not already qualify for special need services should also be considered for enrollment.  In the event that more students seek to enroll than available space permits, districts shall prioritize students (at the time of acceptance) on the basis of family income expressed as a percentage of the federal poverty guidelines, with the lowest family incomes given the highest enrollment priority.        1A.23.      (SDE-EIA: Reading)  The funds allocated to the Department of Education for reading shall be used to provide districts with research-based strategies and professional development and to work directly with schools and districts to assist with implementation of research-based strategies.

The remaining funds will be allocated to districts based on a formula which includes factors such as target populations without a high school credential, program enrollment the previous school year, number of students making an educational gain the previous school year, and performance factors such as number of high school credentials and career readiness certificates awarded the previous school year.  Overall levels of state funding must meet the federal requirement of state maintenance of effort.  Each school district must collect information from both the student and the school including why the student has enrolled in Adult Education and whether or not the student is pursuing a GED or Diploma.  The school district must then provide a quarterly report to the Department of Education and must include the unique student identifier.  The department, in turn, will provide summary information to the House Ways and Means Committee, the House Education and Public Works Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Education Committee on the information.  Up to a maximum of $300,000, of funds may be used to establish an initiative by which qualifying adult education students may qualify for a free high school equivalency test. The Department of Education shall establish guidelines for the free high school equivalency testing initiative.        1A.28.      (SDE-EIA: Clemson Agriculture Education Teachers)  The funds appropriated in Part IA, Section VIII.F. for Clemson Agriculture Education Teachers must be transferred to Clemson University PSA to fund summer employment of agriculture teachers and to cover state-mandated salary increases on that portion of the agriculture teachers' salaries attributable to summer employment.  If sufficient funds remain, Clemson University PSA may utilize such funds for a Regional Coordinator.        1A.29.      (SDE-EIA: Full-Day 4K) Beginning with the current fiscal year, eligible students residing in any school district may participate in the South Carolina Early Reading Development and Education program (CERDEP) pending the availability of space and funding.  Student eligibility as defined by Section 59-156-130 of the 1976 Code is an annual family income of one hundred eighty-five percent or less of the federal poverty guidelines as promulgated annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services or a statement of Medicaid eligibility.        A parent or guardian may choose to enroll their child in a public school participating in the program and approved by the Department of Education pursuant to Section 59-156-210 or in a private provider participating in the program and approved by the Office of First Steps pursuant to Section 59-156-200.  A private provider includes, but is not limited to, a child care center, a military child care facility regulated by the United States Department of Defense, or a non-profit independent school.  State funds appropriated for the provision of CERDEP services in military child care facilities may not be used to supplant existing federal child care funds.        Beginning with the current fiscal year, 4K programs in public schools and non-profit independent schools participating in CERDEP are not required to be approved, registered, or licensed by the Department of Social Services in order to participate in CERDEP.  Instead, the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps are responsible for ensuring that providers deliver high-quality educational programs pursuant to Section 59-156-160.        Public and private providers shall be funded for instructional costs at a rate of $4,800 per student enrolled.  Eligible students enrolling during the school year or withdrawing during the school year shall be funded on a pro rata basis determined by the length of their enrollment.  Private providers transporting eligible children to and from school shall also be eligible for a reimbursement of $587 per eligible child transported.  All providers who are reimbursed are required to retain records as required by their fiscal agent.  New providers participating for the first time in the current fiscal year and enrolling between one and six eligible children shall be eligible to receive up to $1,000 per child in materials and equipment funding, with providers enrolling seven or more such children eligible for funding not to exceed $10,000.  Providers receiving equipment funding are expected to participate in the program and provide high-quality, center-based programs as defined herein for a minimum of three years.  Failure to participate for three years will require the provider to return a portion of the equipment allocation at a level determined by the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps to School Readiness.  Funding to providers is contingent upon receipt of data as requested by the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps.  The Department of Education shall only provide funding for public school students whose complete records have been entered into PowerSchool based on the one hundred and thirty-five day student average daily membership.  For the current fiscal year, providers may enroll pay-lunch children who score at or below the twenty-fifth national percentile on two of the three DIAL-3 subscales by July 1 if at least seventy-five percent of the total number of children eligible or the Child Early Reading Development and Education Program in a district or county are projected to be enrolled in that program, Head Start, or ABC Child Care Program as determined by the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps, Child Early Reading Development and Education Program.  Providers may receive reimbursement for these children if funds are available.        Annually, the Department of Education is directed to audit the annual allocations to public providers to ensure that allocations are accurate and aligned to the appropriate pro rata per student allocation, materials, and equipment funding.  In the event the department, during the audit process determines that the annual allocations of the prior fiscal year are not accurate, the department must adjust the allocations for the current fiscal year to account for the audit findings.  The department must provide the results of the annual audit findings to the General Assembly no later than December first.  Likewise, in the event the Office of First Steps determines that the annual allocations of the prior fiscal year to private providers are not accurate, the Office of First Steps must adjust the allocations for the current fiscal year to account for the findings.        Of the funds appropriated, $300,000 shall be allocated to the Education Oversight Committee to conduct an annual evaluation of the South Carolina Child Development Education Pilot Program and to issue findings in a report to the General Assembly by January fifteenth of each year.  To aid in this evaluation, the Education Oversight Committee shall determine the data necessary and both public and private providers are required to submit the necessary data as a condition of continued participation in and funding of the program.  This data shall include developmentally appropriate measures of student progress.  Additionally, the Department of Education shall issue a unique student identifier for each child receiving services from a private provider.  The Department of Education shall be responsible for the collection and maintenance of data on the public state funded full day and half-day four-year-old kindergarten programs.  The Office of First Steps to School Readiness shall be responsible for the collection and maintenance of data on the state funded programs provided through private providers.  The Education Oversight Committee shall use this data and all other collected and maintained data necessary to conduct a research based review of the program's implementation and assessment of student success in the early elementary grades along with information, recommendations, and a timeline for how the state can increase the number of students served in high-quality programs.        For each school district that chooses not to participate in CERDEP, the district shall receive the same amount of EIA funds as allocated in the prior fiscal year for the provision of a half-day 4K program from the funds appropriated to the Department of Education for CERDEP or from any funds carried forward from the prior fiscal year to CERDEP.  For eligible children residing in school districts that do not participate in CERDEP, the Department of Education is required to develop and implement inter-district transfer policies that give parents or guardians the option of their eligible child attending an out-of-district school that participates in CERDEP.        For the current fiscal year, the Office of First Steps may expend: (1) up to $2,000,000 to pilot a program to provide higher reimbursement rates to high-quality child care centers.  The reimbursement rate for students enrolled by child care providers rated B or higher in the ABC Quality System operated by the Department of Social Services may be increased by up to 10% of the per-student base following guidelines developed by the Office of First Steps; and (2) up to $100,000 to provide one-time supplemental, needs-based incentive grants in an amount not to exceed $30,000 for newly created and/or newly approved private providers proposing to expand service to ten or more CERDEP eligible children in communities unable to enroll all eligible students in a public, private, or Head Start setting during the prior fiscal year.  These grants are designed to address building renovations, documented as necessary to bring proposed classrooms into compliance with licensing regulations, materials and staffing costs, and/or other obstacles currently preventing their participation in the program.  The First Steps Board of Trustees shall develop and approve an application process that incorporates formal review and fiscal safeguards designed to ensure grant funds are used solely to address documented barriers to program participation.  Providers receiving this one-time supplement shall be expected to participate in the program and provide high-quality, center-based programs as defined herein for a minimum of three years.  Failure to participate for three years shall require the provider to return a portion of the supplemental allocation at a level determined by the Office of First Steps to School Readiness.  First Steps shall submit a report detailing its process, expenditures and expanded enrollment to the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee by March 15; and (3) up to $1,000,000 may be used to provide grants to public-private partnerships to address building renovations and designs necessary to get the building and classrooms into compliance with licensing regulations and other obstacles that prevent participation in CERDEP following guidelines developed by the Office of First Steps.  Providers participating in this pilot shall be expected to participate in the program and provide high-quality, center-based programs as defined herein for a minimum of three years.  Failure to participate for three years shall require the provider to return a portion of the supplemental allocation at a level determined by the Office of First Steps.        If by August first, the Department of Education or the Office of First Steps determines that appropriations will exceed expenditures, available funds may be used to fund an extended program and to increase the length of the program to a maximum of eight and a half hours per day or two hundred and twenty days per year or to fund summer programs.  If a district chooses to fund summer enrollment, the program funding shall conform to the funding in this act for full year programs; however, it shall be reduced on a pro rata basis to conform with the length of the program.  A summer program shall be no more than eight and a half hours per day and shall be not more than ten weeks in length.  The per pupil allocation and classroom grant must conform with the appropriated amount contained in this Act and end of year adjustments shall be based on the one hundred and thirty-five-day student average daily membership or later student average daily membership for districts choosing to extend the program past one hundred and eighty days.  Funds may also be used to provide parent engagement, professional development and quality evaluations of programs.  No later than April first, the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps shall report to the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on the expenditure of these funds to include the following information:  the amount of money used and specific steps and measures taken to enhance the quality of the 4K program and the amount of money used for professional development as well as the types of professional development offered and the number of participants.  The Office of First Steps is directed to determine if the provision of extended programs in private centers improves the ability of parents to enter the workforce or to pursue postsecondary training or industry credentials.        On or before November 15, the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps shall share data that identifies the total number of children enrolled in CERDEP in both public and private providers.  If available appropriations exceed the instructional costs of serving children enrolled in the program and if a waiting list of eligible children can be documented by the Department of Education and by the Office of First Steps, then the Executive Budget Office may authorize the transfer of funds between the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps.        The Office of First Steps and the Department of Education shall collaborate with the South Carolina Head Start State Collaboration Office to inform parents of all publicly funded full-day 4K programs including Head Start.        For Fiscal Year 2021-22, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, children who were eligible to participate in the Child Early Reading Development and Education Program in the prior fiscal year but did not participate, shall be eligible to participate in the program during Fiscal Year 2021-22, subject to classroom availability and funding.       1A.30.      (SDE-EIA: Aid to Districts)  Funds appropriated in Part IA, Section 1, VIII.A.1. Aid to Districts shall be dispersed monthly to school districts.  For the current fiscal year, the remaining funds shall be allocated to districts based on the number of weighted pupil units.       1A.31.      (SDE-EIA: Centers of Excellence)  Of the funds appropriated for Centers of Excellence, $350,000 must be allocated to the Francis Marion University Center of Excellence to Prepare Teachers of Children of Poverty to expand statewide training for individuals who teach children of poverty through weekend college, nontraditional or alternative learning opportunities.        1A.32.      (SDE-EIA: IDEA Maintenance of Effort)  Prior to the dispersal of funds appropriated in Section VIII.A.1. Aid to Districts according to Proviso 1A.30 for the current fiscal year, in the event that there is a reduction in state funds or there are changes in the Education Finance Act/Base Student Cost formula that would reduce support for children with disabilities, the Department of Education is authorized to utilize funds appropriated in Section VIII.A.1. Aid to Districts to ensure maintenance of state financial support for the IDEA.  The department shall distribute these funds using the current fiscal year one hundred thirty-five day Average Daily Membership or as directed by the United States Department of Education.  Funds provided for these purposes may not be transferred to any other purpose and therefore are not subject to flexibility.  For continued compliance with the federal maintenance of state financial support requirements of the IDEA, funding for children with disabilities must, to the extent practicable, be held harmless to budget cuts or reductions to the extent those funds are required to meet federal maintenance of state financial support requirements under the IDEA.  In the event cuts to funds that are needed to maintain fiscal effort are necessary, when administering such cuts, the department must not reduce funding to support children with disabilities who qualify for services under the IDEA in a manner that is disproportionate to the level of overall reduction to state programs in general.  By December first, the department must submit an estimate of the IDEA maintenance of state financial support requirement to the General Assembly and the Governor.  For the current fiscal year, the department may carry forward IDEA Maintenance of Effort funds from the prior fiscal year and expend them in the same manner.        1A.33.      (SDE-EIA: Career Cluster Industry Partnerships)  From the funds appropriated to the Department of Education, $800,000 must be provided as direct grants to the private sector statewide trade association or educational foundation providing nationally certified programs in career and technology education representing the automotive, construction, engineering, healthcare, mechanical contracting/construction, and hospitality tourism career clusters.  Organizations applying for a grant must do so by July thirty-first and the Department of Education must award a minimum of one grant of at least $150,000 in at least four of these specified career clusters to be used exclusively for career and technology education.  The recipient industry organization must conduct end-of-course exams graded by a national industry organization and must include in their grant request how the money will be spent in direct support of students to further industry-specific career technology education; a description and history of their program nationally and within South Carolina; estimates of future employment growth in their industry; and the national scope of their program.  By August first of the following year, the organization must submit to the department a report detailing how the grant increased industry/employer awareness; the number of increased schools using the industry-based curriculum and partnered with the industry organization; the increased number of students in the program; and an overview and analysis of the organization's statewide student competition.  The grant must be used for career awareness programs for that industry cluster; statewide student competitions leading to national competitions; teacher development and training; post-secondary scholarships in industry-specific degree programs; student recruitment into that career cluster programs; programs to educate middle and high school Career or Guidance Counselors about the industry; service to disadvantaged youth; and administering business/employer awareness and partnerships which help lead to experience-based, career-oriented experiences including internships, apprenticeships, mentoring, co-op education and service learning.  The Office of Career and Technology Education of the department will develop goals with each career cluster on the number of new schools using the industry-based curriculum and partnered with that career cluster organization.  These funds may not be used to supplant or replace, in whole or in part, other existing resources/assets sourced outside the present grant being used to provide the same services or programs.  Organizations may carry-over grants for up to three years when a large project is identified in the grant application to be used at a future date; otherwise excess funds must be returned to the state.  Organizations awarded must submit a semi-annual programmatic and financial report on the last day of December in addition to the final report due August first that has been audited by a third party accounting firm.       1A.34.      (SDE-EIA: Partnerships/Other Agencies &amp; Entities)  For the current fiscal year, agencies and other entities receiving funds appropriated in Part IA, Section 1, VIII. F. will continue to report annually to the Education Oversight Committee (EOC).  Any entity receiving funds that must flow through a state agency will receive those funds through the EOC, unless requested in writing by the entity to match federal or other funds.  The EOC will make funding recommendations to the Governor and General Assembly as part of the agency's annual budget request.       1A.35.      (SDE-EIA: ETV Teacher Training/Support)  Of the funds appropriated in Part IA, Section 1, VIII.F. South Carolina Educational Television must provide training and technical support on the educational resources available to teachers and school districts.        1A.36.      (SDE-EIA: Teacher Salaries/SE Average)  The projected Southeastern average teacher salary shall be the average of the average teachers' salaries of the southeastern states as projected by the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.  For the current school year the Southeastern average teacher salary is projected to be $53,426.  The General Assembly remains desirous of raising the average teacher salary in South Carolina through incremental increases over the next few years so as to make such equivalent to the national average teacher salary.        Additionally, for the current fiscal year, a local school district board of trustees must increase the salary compensation for all eligible certified teachers employed by the district by no less than one year of experience credit using the district salary schedule utilized the prior fiscal year as the basis for providing the step.  Application of this provision must be applied uniformly for all eligible certified teachers.  For Fiscal Year 2021-22, the requirement that school districts maintain local salary supplements per teacher no less than their prior fiscal year level is suspended if additional State funds fill the gap.        Funds allocated by Proviso 1.3 for implementing a revised state minimum salary schedule for Teacher Salaries must be used to increase salaries of those teachers eligible pursuant to Section 59-20-50(4)(b), to include classroom teachers, librarians, guidance counselors, psychologists, social workers, occupational and physical therapists, school nurses, orientation/mobility instructors, and audiologists in the school districts of the state by not less than one thousand dollars.  Districts must use the district salary schedule utilized the prior fiscal year as the basis for providing the increase.        For purposes of this provision teachers shall be defined by the Department of Education using the Professional Certified Staff (PCS) System.        1A.37.      (SDE-EIA: PowerSchool Dropout Recovery Data)  With the funds appropriated to the Department of Education for PowerSchool and data collection, the department will begin in the current fiscal year to collect data from schools and school districts on the number of students who had previously dropped out of school and who reenrolled in a public school or adult education to pursue a high school diploma.  The Education Oversight Committee working with the Department of Education will determine how to calculate a dropout recovery rate that will be reflected on the annual school and district report cards.  The department may carry forward and expend the funds for the same purpose.        1A.38.      (SDE-EIA: Assisting, Developing and Evaluating Professional Teaching -ADEPT)  With funds appropriated in the current fiscal year, the Department of Education, school districts, the Department of Juvenile Justice and special schools of the state may continue implementation of the ADEPT program.

The funds appropriated to the State Board for Technical and Comprehensive Education (SBTCE) for Workforce Scholarships and Grants shall be used to provide grants for tuition, fees, transportation, or textbook expenses to South Carolina residents enrolled in a career education program that meets all eligibility guidelines promulgated by the SBTCE in consultation with the Department of Education.  Funds shall not be used for continuing education courses that do not lead to a degree, professional certificate, or industry-recognized credential (IRC).        (A)      Prior to disbursement of funds and no later than July 30, SBTCE must provide the colleges with a Board approved list, compiled based on regional and statewide industry needs of the programs and credentials for which the colleges are allowed to award grants for the current fiscal year.        (B)      Grants shall be awarded from the fund in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars or the total cost of attendance, whichever is less, for students to attend the program of their choice, including a professional certification program, at a South Carolina public technical college.  Priority for grant awards shall be given to students seeking a degree, professional certificate, or industry-recognized credential (IRC) in an industry sector with critical workforce needs as identified and recommended by the SBTCE and ratified by the Coordinating Council for Workforce Development.        (C)      By April fifteenth, the SBTCE shall provide a report to the Chairman of House Ways and Means Committee and the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee detailing use of funds received in the prior fiscal year.  The report must include at minimum for each technical college: a list of programs that received funding, amount spent per program, number of students that received grants, grant amount per student, names of credentials completed by students receiving grants, amount of each type of credential completed, and job placement rates for students who completed programs and/or credentials.        Of the funds appropriated to the State Board for Technical and Comprehensive Education for the South Carolina Workforce Industry Needs Scholarship, the board shall administer the South Carolina Workforce Industry Needs Scholarship as outlined below:              (A)      (1)      In the current fiscal year, a student attending a two year public technical college and majoring in a critical workforce area program, as defined and recommended by the State Board for Technical and Comprehensive Education (SBTCE) and ratified by the South Carolina Coordinating Council for Workforce Development, and who is receiving a Lottery Tuition Assistance Program Scholarship (LTAP) for the current fiscal year, shall receive an additional South Carolina Workforce Industry Needs Scholarship (SC WINS).  A student who is attending a two-year public technical college, who meets the income eligibility guidelines for free and reduced-priced meals as established by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and who is receiving a LTAP scholarship for the current fiscal year, shall receive a SC WINS scholarship regardless of the student's major.  The SC WINS scholarship is equal to the cost of tuition and mandatory fees after applying all other scholarships or grants, not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars.                          (2)      If the student is a freshman, the student must be enrolled in at least six credit hours of instruction each semester, including at least three credit hours of instruction in one of the critical workforce areas defined by the SBTCE.  A student who meets the income guidelines for free and reduced-priced meals as established by the USDA, must be enrolled in at least six credit hours of instruction each semester for the purpose of meeting the required minimum level of instruction in the student's major courses.  To receive the additional SC WINS scholarship, the student must receive the underlying LTAP scholarship for that fiscal year and must be making acceptable progress towards receiving a degree in one of the majors pursuant to this proviso. For purposes of meeting this required minimum level of instruction in the freshman's major courses, dual enrollment courses taken in high school in these critical workforce area programs count toward the fulfillment of the minimum requirement.              (B)      The SBTCE shall adopt rules to define what constitutes a critical workforce program area. Nothing herein prevents a student from changing majors within the acceptable disciplines. Additionally, the SBTCE shall communicate with high school guidance counselors regarding the list of qualifying majors. Critical workforce program additions or deletions must be ratified by the South Carolina Coordinating Council for Workforce Development.

The intent is to identify those obligations which are long-term debt or tantamount to long-term debt, or those which, if not honored, might result in a negative rating action on the institution's or the State's credit rating.  Such obligations would not include either general obligation debt or bonded indebtedness issued directly by an institution.        (B)      "Long-term obligation" means:                    (1)      an arrangement to acquire an interest in or a right to use, or have others use, any type of property if all or a portion of the money required to pay for the acquisition is secured through fare, toll, or user charges;                    (2)      an arrangement to acquire an interest in or a right to use, or have others use, any type of property if (a) the arrangement is financed, directly or indirectly, with indebtedness undertaken by another for that purpose; (b) the state institution knows or should know the acquisition is financed by indebtedness; and, (c) the state institution is obligated to make, or undertakes to have others make, recurring payments on, or that another will use to make payments on, the indebtedness; or,                    (3)      any of the following arrangements:  (a) lease-purchase agreement; (b) leaseback agreement; (c) installment purchase agreement; (d) lease with an option to purchase for other than the then-current fair market value; (e) lease with option to renew for nominal or no additional consideration; (f) an agreement involving collateral, such as a mortgage or security interest; (g) a public private partnership; (h) an agreement structured as either design-build-operate-maintain or design-build-finance-operate-maintain, as defined in Section 11-35-2910; (i) a finance lease, as defined in Section 36-2A-103(1)(g); (j) a transaction in the form of a lease that creates a security interest, as addressed in Section 36-1-203(b); or (k) a guaranteed energy, water, or wastewater savings contract, as authorized by Section 48-52-670(A).

The report should exclude the following:  (1) general obligation debt authorized under Section 13, Article X of the Constitution of South Carolina, 1895, and debt issued by the state institution under Section 13, Article X of the Constitution of South Carolina, 1895, but not debt issued under Section 13 or 14 of Article X on its behalf or for its benefit; and (2) an institution's obligation to make payments when the total amount of money needed for the obligation is committed for that purpose, authorized for expenditure, and in hand.

(E)      The State Auditor shall conduct the study and issue a final report no later than one hundred and twenty days after the beginning of the current fiscal year.  State institutions must fully respond within forty-five days to any formal request for information from the State Auditor.

For each job group referenced in the Human Affairs report, where the hiring of personnel does not reflect the percentage goals established in the agency's affirmative action plan for the year in question, the state agency shall submit a detailed explanation to the Human Affairs Commission by February fifteenth, explaining why goals were not achieved.        The Human Affairs Commission shall review the explanations and notify the Department of Administration of any agency not in satisfactory compliance with meeting its stated goals.

(a)      That within thirty days of the passage of the Appropriation Act or by August first, whichever comes later, each agency of the State must have established on the Executive Budget Office records all positions authorized in the Act.  Each agency may, upon notification to the Executive Budget Office, change the funding source of state FTE positions established on the Executive Budget Office records as necessary to expend federal and other sources of personal service funds to conserve or stay within the state appropriated personal service funds.  No agency shall change funding sources that will cause the agency to exceed the authorized number of state or total full-time equivalent positions.  Each agency may transfer FTEs between programs as needed to accomplish the agency mission.                          (b)      That by September thirtieth, the office shall prepare a FTE analysis, by agency, which shows the number of authorized, filled, and vacant positions by source of funds for the current and two previously completed fiscal years.

(b)      The state FTE shall be derived by multiplying the state percentage of budgeted funds for each position by the FTE for that position.                          (c)      All institutions of higher education shall use a value of 0.75 FTE for each position determined to be full-time faculty with a duration of nine months.        The FTE method of accounting shall be utilized for all authorized positions.              (4)      That the number of positions authorized in this act shall be reduced in the following circumstances:                          (a)      Upon request by an agency.

(c)      When the Executive Budget Office, through study or analysis, becomes aware of any unjustifiable excess of positions in any state agency.              (5)      That no new permanent positions in state government shall be funded by appropriations in acts supplemental to this act but temporary positions may be so funded.              (6)      That the provisions of this section shall not apply to personnel exempt from the State Classification and Compensation Plan under item I of Section 8-11-260 of the 1976 Code.

Replacement of damaged or destroyed items shall not exceed $250 per item, per incident.  Each agency must have guidelines to insure the reasonableness of the replacement payments.       117.18.

For travel outside of South Carolina the maximum daily reimbursement for meals shall not exceed $50.

The report shall also include, but not be limited to, data regarding the number of offenders sentenced to electronic monitoring, including the number sentenced for life; the number of alert notifications received, investigated, and prosecuted; and the number of offenders returned to prison as a result of electronic monitoring violations.        117.59.      (GP: Viscosupplementation Therapies Sales and Use Tax Exemption)  For the current fiscal year only, sales and use taxes on viscosupplementation therapies shall be suspended.

(GP: CID &amp; PCC Agency Head Salaries)  All hiring salaries and salary increases for the agency heads of the Commission on Indigent Defense and the Prosecution Coordination Commission shall be subject to all provisions related to agency heads covered by the Agency Head Salary Commission.        117.61.      (GP: Prosecutors and Defenders Public Service Incentive Program)  The Office of Attorney General, the Commission on Prosecution Coordination, and the Commission on Indigent Defense shall develop and implement a Prosecutors and Defenders Public Service Incentive Program for attorneys employed by the Office of Attorney General, the Commission on Prosecution Coordination, the Commission on Indigent Defense, a Circuit Solicitor's Office or a Circuit Public Defender's Office.        After more than three years of continuous service as a full-time attorney with any of these entities, qualifying attorneys may be reimbursed up to $1,000 for payments made in the prior calendar year on outstanding law school loans.  Reimbursements for law school loan payments may be increased by up to $1,000 for each additional year of continuous service; however, such reimbursements shall not exceed $5,000 in any year.  The amount of law school loan payment reimbursement in any calendar year shall not exceed the amount of principal and interest paid on the loan in the prior calendar year.  Reimbursements under the program may continue until all outstanding law school loans are satisfied; however, such reimbursements shall not exceed $40,000 per qualifying attorney.  Reimbursements shall be adjusted if necessary so as not to exceed appropriations for the program.        The Prosecutors and Defenders Public Service Incentive Program must be administered by the Commission on Prosecution Coordination, which shall pay for the cost of administration within the funds appropriated.        The Office of Attorney General, the Commission on Prosecution Coordination, and the Commission on Indigent Defense shall each compile a report that includes, but is not limited to, the number of applicants and the impact of the program on attracting and retaining attorneys.  The Commission on Prosecution Coordination shall also compile a report that includes, but is not limited to, the cost of administering the program as well as the amount of reimbursements per agency or entity.  Such reports shall be submitted to the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee by April first.        Unexpended program funds from the prior fiscal year may be carried forward into the current fiscal year to be used for the same purpose.       117.62.      (GP: Attorney Dues)  Agencies and offices of the State of South Carolina that employ attorneys are authorized, if they so decide, to use other appropriated funds, including General Fund carry forward funds, to pay the costs of mandatory dues owed to the South Carolina Bar Association.        117.63.      (GP: Critical Employee Recruitment and Retention)  State agencies are allowed to spend state, federal, and other sources of revenue to provide lump sum bonuses to aid in recruiting and retaining workers in critical needs jobs which provide services that directly impact the health, safety, and welfare of the public.  The employee bonus amount shall be approved by the State Human Resources Director based on State Human Resources guidelines, and shall not exceed $10,000 per year.  Payment of these bonuses is not a part of the employee's base salary and is not earnable compensation for purposes of employee and employer contributions to respective retirement systems.  These bonuses shall, however, be considered earnings for determining if an employee who has returned to work after retirement is subject to the earning limitation imposed in either Section 9-1-1790(A)(1) or Section 9-11-(4)(a)(i).        These agencies may also provide paid educational leave for any employee in a FTE position deemed critical by the Department of Administration to attend class while enrolled in degree programs that are related to the agency's mission.  All such leave is at the agency head's discretion.        These agencies may enter into an agreement with individuals employed in critical needs positions to repay them for their outstanding student loans associated with completion of a relevant degree.  Agencies may pay these employees up to twenty percent or $7,500, whichever is less, of their outstanding student loan each year over a five-year period.  Payments will be made directly to the employee at the end of each year of employment.  The agency will be responsible for verifying the principal balance of the employee's student loan prior to issuing payments.        Agencies are also authorized to allow tuition reimbursement from a maximum of ten credit hours per semester; allow probationary employees to participate in tuition programs; and provide tuition prepayment instead of tuition reimbursement for employees willing to pursue a degree in a healthcare program.  An agency may pay up to fifty percent of an employee's tuition through tuition prepayment.  The remaining tuition could be reimbursed to the employee after successful completion of the class.        The Department of Administration shall approve of the designation of critical needs positions applicable to this provision using guidelines that include, but are not limited to:  1) the difficulty recruiting for the positions as reflected by data such as the vacancy rate maintained, the average time to fill, the lack of sufficient qualified applicants, and other objective factors; 2) the difficulty retaining employees in the positions as shown by turnover data; 3) justification by the state agency that the position is critical to the core mission of the agency and directly impacts the health, safety and welfare of the public; and 4) assurances from the state agency that there are sufficient existing funds available to pay for items under this provision.        Healthcare employees in approved critical needs positions working on a practicum or required clinical experience towards completion of a healthcare degree may be allowed to complete these requirements at their state agency or another state agency at the discretion of the agency head.  This field placement at another state agency may be considered work time for participating employees.        State agencies must report to the Department of Administration by August 31st of each year any expenditure under this provision.  The Department of Administration shall compile a report of the responses and submit them to the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee by October 1st of each year.        117.64.      (GP: Governor's Budget Certification)  The annual Executive Budget proposed by the Governor must be certified by the Director of the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office or his designee in the same manner as the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee versions of the budget bill are certified.       117.65.      (GP: Voluntary Furlough)  Agency heads may institute a voluntary employee furlough program of not more than ninety days per fiscal year.  During this voluntary furlough, the state employees shall be entitled to participate in the same state benefits as otherwise available to them except for receiving their salaries.  As to those benefits which require employer and employee contributions, the state agencies, institutions and departments will be responsible for making both employer and employee contributions if coverage would otherwise be interrupted; and as to those benefits which require only employee contributions, the employee remains solely responsible for making those contributions.  In the event an agency's reduction is due solely to the General Assembly transferring or deleting a program, this provision does not apply.       117.66.      (GP: Governor's Security Detail)  The State Law Enforcement Division, the Department of Public Safety, and the Department of Natural Resources shall provide a security detail to the Governor in a manner agreed to by the State Law Enforcement Division, the Department of Public Safety, the Department of Natural Resources, and the Office of Governor.  Reimbursement to the State Law Enforcement Division, the Department of Public Safety, and the Department of Natural Resources to offset the cost of the security detail for the Governor shall be made in an amount agreed to by the State Law Enforcement Division, the Department of Public Safety, the Department of Natural Resources, and the Office of Governor from funds appropriated to the Office of Governor for this purpose.  Law enforcement officers assigned to security detail for the Governor shall only perform services related to security and shall not provide any unrelated service during the assignment.        117.67.      (GP: Reduction in Force Antidiscrimination)  In the event of a reduction in force implemented by a state agency or institution, the state agency or institution must comply with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or any other applicable federal or state antidiscrimination laws.        117.68.      (GP: Reduction in Force/Agency Head Furlough)  In the event a reduction in force is implemented by a state agency or institution of higher learning, the agency head shall be required to take five days furlough in the current fiscal year.  If more than one reduction in force plan is implemented in a fiscal year, the mandatory agency head furlough is only required for the initial plan.  The agency head will retain all responsibilities and authority during the furlough.  All monies saved from this furlough may be retained by that agency and expended at the discretion of the agency head.  During this furlough, the agency head shall be entitled to participate in the same state benefits as otherwise available to them except for receiving their salaries.  As to those benefits which require employer and employee contributions, the state agency will be responsible for making both employer and employee contributions if coverage would otherwise be interrupted; and as to those benefits which require only employee contributions, the agency head remains solely responsible for making those contributions.        Placement of an agency head on furlough under this provision does not constitute a grievance or appeal under the State Employee Grievance Procedure Act.  In the event the reduction for the state agency or institution of higher learning is due solely to the General Assembly transferring or deleting a program, this provision does not apply.  Agencies may allocate the agency head's reduction in pay over the balance of the fiscal year for payroll purposes regardless of the pay period within which the furlough occurs.  The Department of Administration shall promulgate guidelines and policies, as necessary, to implement the provisions of this proviso.  State agencies shall report information regarding furloughs to the Department of Administration.        For purposes of this provision, agency head includes the president of a technical college as defined by Section 59-103-5 of the 1976 Code.        The agency head of the State Board for Technical and Comprehensive Education shall not be required to take this mandatory furlough based solely on the implementation of a reduction in force plan by a technical college.        An agency head shall not be required to take this mandatory furlough based solely on reductions in force implemented as a result of federal budget cuts or reorganization to accomplish organizational efficiencies.        117.69.      (GP: Printed Report Requirements)  (A)  For the current fiscal year, state supported institutions of higher learning shall not be required to submit printed reports mandated by Sections 2-47-40, 2-47-50, and 59-103-110 of the 1976 Code, and shall instead only submit the documents electronically.        Submission of the plans or reports required by Sections 59-101-350, 59-103-30, 59-103-45(4), and 59-103-160(D) shall be waived for the current fiscal year, except institutions of higher learning must continue to report student pass rates on professional examinations, and data elements otherwise required for the Commission on Higher Education Management Information System.  The commission, in consultation with institutions, shall take further action to reduce data reporting burdens as possible.        (B)      For the current fiscal year, the Department of Agriculture shall not be required to submit printed reports mandated by Section 46-49-10 of the 1976 Code.  The department shall provide these reports electronically and shall use any monetary savings for K5-12 agricultural education programs.        (C)      For the current fiscal year, the Department of Health and Human Services shall not be required to provide printed copies of the Medicaid Annual Report required pursuant to Section 44-6-80 of the 1976 Code and shall instead only submit the documents electronically.        (D)      For the current fiscal year, the Department of Transportation shall not be required to submit printed reports or publications mandated by Sections 1-11-58, 2-47-55, and 58-17-1450 of the 1976 Code.        The Department of Transportation may combine their Annual Report and Mass Transit Report into their Annual Accountability Report.        117.70.      (GP: IMD Operations)  The Department of Health and Human Services shall produce an annual report on Medicaid-funded out-of-home placements and associated expenditures which shall be provided to the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and the Governor no later than November first each year.        117.71.      (GP: Fines and Fees Report)  In order to promote accountability and transparency, each state agency must provide and release to the public via the agency's website, a report of all aggregate amounts of fines and fees that were charged and collected by that state agency in the prior fiscal year.  The report shall include, but not be limited to:  (1) the code section, regulation, or proviso that authorized the fines and fees to be charged, collected, or received; (2) the amount of the fine or fee; (3) the amount received by source; (4) the purpose for which the funds were expended by the agency; (5) the amount of funds transferred to the general fund, if applicable, and the authority by which the transfer took place; and (6) the amount of funds transferred to another entity, if applicable, and the authority by which the transfer took place, as well as the name of the entity to which the funds were transferred.  The report must be posted online by September first.  Additionally, the report must be delivered to the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee by September first.  Funds appropriated to and/or authorized for use by each state agency shall be used to accomplish this directive.        117.72.      (GP: Mandatory Furlough)  In a fiscal year in which the general funds appropriated for a state agency are less than the general funds appropriated for that agency in the prior fiscal year, or whenever the General Assembly or the Executive Budget Office implements a midyear across-the-board budget reduction, and agency heads institute a mandatory employee furlough program, in determining which employees must participate in the program, agency heads should give consideration to furloughs for contract employees, post-TERI employees, and TERI employees before other employees.  During this mandatory furlough, the state employees shall be entitled to participate in the same state benefits as otherwise available to them except for receiving their salaries.  As to those benefits which require employer and employee contributions, the state agencies, institutions, and departments will be responsible for making both employer and employee contributions if coverage would otherwise be interrupted; and as to those benefits which require only employee contributions, the employee remains solely responsible for making those contributions.  In the event an agency's reduction is due solely to the General Assembly transferring or deleting a program, this provision does not apply.       117.73.      (GP: Reduction In Force)  In a fiscal year in which the general funds appropriated for a state agency are less than the general funds appropriated for that agency in the prior fiscal year, or whenever the General Assembly or the Executive Budget Office implements a midyear across-the-board budget reduction, and agency heads must make reductions in force, agency heads should give consideration to reductions of contract employees, post-TERI employees, and TERI employees before other employees.  In the event an agency's reduction is due solely to the General Assembly transferring or deleting a program, this provision does not apply.        117.74.      (GP: Cost Savings When Filling Vacancies Created by Retirements)  During the current fiscal year, whenever classified FTEs become vacant because of employee retirements, it is the intent of the General Assembly that state agencies should realize personnel costs savings of at least twenty-five percent in the aggregate when managing these vacant positions.  Prior to filling a classified FTE which has become vacant because of a retirement, an agency must review and determine the appropriate salary for the position as well as determine whether the agency can manage without filling the position or by delay in filling the position.  Prior to filling the vacant FTE, agencies must follow all laws and regulations concerning posting and competitive solicitation and consideration of applicants.  No agency shall enter into any agreement with any employee that violates the terms of this proviso.        117.75.      (GP: Information Technology for Health Care)  From the funds appropriated and authorized to the Department of Health and Human Services , the department shall advance the use of health information technology and health information exchange to improve quality and efficiency of health care and to decrease the costs of health care as follows:              (A)      In order to facilitate the qualification of Medicare and/or Medicaid eligible providers and hospitals for incentive payments for meaningful health information technology (HIT) use, a health care organization participating in the South Carolina Health Information Exchange (SCHIEx) or a Regional Health Information Organization (RHIO) or a hospital system health information exchange (HIE) that participates in SCHIEx may release patient records and medical information, including the results of any laboratory or other tests ordered or requested by an authorized health care provider within the scope of his or her license or practice act, to another health information organization that requests the information via a HIE for treatment purposes with or without express written consent or authorization from the patient.  A health information organization that receives or views this information from a patient's electronic health record or incorporates this information into the health information organization's electronic medical record for the patient in providing treatment is considered an authorized person for purposes of 42 C.F.R. 493.2 and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments.              (B)      There is established the Health Information Exchange Strategy Development Committee to make recommendations on the development of a statewide HIE strategy that is intended to promote interoperability for purposes of improving patient safety, eliminating redundant or unnecessary testing, and increasing the efficiency of the healthcare system.  The committee shall assess other states' approaches to governing, financing, and implementing their statewide HIE efforts, including enhanced funding made available through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or other relevant agencies, and shall report its findings and recommendations to the Governor, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee no later than November 15, 2021.  The committee shall consider and leverage the capabilities of existing exchanges and organizations already present in South Carolina and shall solicit and evaluate the input of appropriate stakeholders, including but not limited to, those represented on the committee.  Upon the request of the committee, the department shall furnish staff and other necessary resources to support the work of the committee, which shall be comprised of the following:                          (1)      the director of the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office or his designee, who shall serve as chair;                          (2)      the director of the Department of Health and Human Services or his designee;                          (3)      the director of the Department of Health and Environmental Control or his designee;                          (4)      the president of the Medical University of South Carolina or his designee;                          (5)      the CEO of the South Carolina Hospital Association or his designee;                          (6)      the CEO of the South Carolina Medical Association or his designee;                          (7)      the CEO of the South Carolina Primary Health Care Association or his designee; and                          (8)      an individual with substantial HIE experience, who shall be appointed by the Governor.              (C)      The department shall be authorized to use any of its available and uncommitted funds to develop, submit, or implement any advance planning documents or other similar plans in furtherance of a statewide HIE strategy, and to secure any available federal funding.  The department shall expeditiously prepare and submit any such documents or plans, particularly if necessary to meet any federal deadlines.        117.76.      (GP: Broadband Spectrum Lease)  The General Assembly must approve any exercise of the Middle Band Segment Channel recapture provisions contained in the Educational Broadband Service Spectrum Lease Agreements if the exercise of the recapture provisions would result in a decrease in payments received by the State.  The Educational Television Commission assumes management and administration of the lease and receives lease payments directly.  The Educational Television Commission shall retain and expend funds received pursuant to the lease for agency operations.  The commission shall be authorized to carry forward unexpended funds from the prior fiscal year into the current fiscal year.  In the event of a default by the current lease holder, the Educational Television Commission is authorized to use contingent funds up until such time as a new lease can be negotiated by the State and the Educational Television Commission.        117.77.      (GP: Reduction in Compensation)  For the current fiscal year, no state agency or political subdivision of this state may decrease the compensation of an employee, including dismissal, suspension, or demotion, solely because the employee gave sworn testimony regarding alleged wrongdoing to a standing committee, subcommittee of a standing committee, or study committee of the Senate or the House of Representatives.  This proviso shall apply regardless of when the alleged wrongdoing occurred.        117.78.      (GP: Deficit Monitoring)  It is the responsibility of each state agency, department, and institution to operate within the limits of its authorized appropriations.  All agencies, departments, and institutions are to budget, allocate and manage its authorized appropriations in a way to avoid an operating deficit for the fiscal year.        If at the end of each quarterly deficit monitoring review by the Executive Budget Office, it is determined by either the Executive Budget Office or a state agency, department, or institution that the likelihood of a deficit for the current fiscal year exists, the state agency shall notify the General Assembly within fifteen days of this determination and shall further request the Executive Budget Office to work with it to develop a plan to avoid the deficit.  Within fifteen days of the deficit avoidance plan being completed, the Executive Budget Office shall either request the General Assembly to recognize the deficit if it determines the deficit avoidance plan will not be sufficient to avoid a deficit or notify the General Assembly of how the deficit will be avoided based on the deficit avoidance plan if the Executive Budget Office determines the plan will be sufficient to avoid a deficit.        Upon notification from the Executive Budget Office that an agency will run a deficit and requesting that it be recognized, the General Assembly, by joint resolution, may make a finding that the cause of, or likelihood of, a deficit is unavoidable due to factors which are outside the control of the state agency, department, or institution, and recognize the deficit.  Any legislation to recognize a deficit must be in a separate joint resolution enacted for the sole purpose of recognizing the deficit of a particular state agency, department, or institution.  A deficit may only be recognized by an affirmative vote of each branch of the General Assembly.        If the General Assembly recognizes the deficit, then the actual deficit at the close of the fiscal year must be reduced as necessary from surplus revenues or surplus funds available at the close of the fiscal year in which the deficit occurs and from funds available in the General Reserve Fund and the Capital Reserve Fund, as required by the Constitution of this State.        Once a deficit has been recognized by the General Assembly, the state agency, department, or institution shall limit travel and conference attendance to that which is deemed essential by the director of the agency, department, or institution.  In addition, the General Assembly, when recognizing a deficit may direct that any pay increases and purchases of equipment and vehicles must be approved by the Executive Budget Office.        117.79.      (GP: Commuting Costs)  State government employees who use a permanently assigned agency or state-owned vehicle to commute from their permanently assigned work location to and from the employee's home must reimburse the agency in which they are employed for commuting use in accordance with IRS regulations based on guidance from the Office of Comptroller General which must use the Cents per mile Rule, unless they are exempted from such reimbursement by applicable IRS regulations.  These permanently assigned vehicles must be clearly marked as a state or agency vehicle through the use of permanent state-government license plates and either state or agency seal decals unless the vehicle is used primarily in undercover operations.  This requirement does not apply to a vehicle used by an employee for the purpose of a special travel assignment, for active certified law enforcement officers authorized to carry firearms, execute warrants, and make arrests, for Constitutional Officers, or for Department of Transportation employees on call for emergency maintenance.        117.80.      (GP: Bank Account Transparency and Accountability)  Each state agency, except state institutions of higher learning, which has composite reservoir bank accounts or any other accounts containing public funds which are not included in the Comptroller General's South Carolina Enterprise Information System shall prepare a report for each account disclosing every transaction of the account in the prior fiscal year.  The report shall be submitted to the State Fiscal Accountability Authority by October first of each fiscal year.  The report shall include the name(s) and title(s) of each person authorized to sign checks or make withdrawals from each account, the name and title of each person responsible for reconciling each account, the beginning and year-end balance of funds in each account, and data related to both deposits and expenditures of each account.  The report shall include, but not be limited to, the date, amount, and source of each deposit transaction and the date, name of the payee, the transaction amount, and a description of the goods or services purchased for each expenditure transaction.  To facilitate review, the State Fiscal Accountability Authority shall prescribe a common format for the report which agencies must use.  In order to promote accountability and transparency, a link to the report shall be posted on the Comptroller General's website as well as the agency's homepage.        When the State Auditor conducts or contracts for an audit of a state agency, accounts of the agency subject to this proviso must be included as part of the review.        If an agency determines that the release of the information required in this provision would be detrimental to the state or the agency, the agency may petition the State Fiscal Accountability Authority to grant the agency an exemption from the reporting requirements for the detrimental portion.  The meeting to determine whether an exemption should be granted shall be closed.  However, the exemption may only be granted upon a majority vote of the State Fiscal Accountability Authority in a public meeting.       117.81.      (GP: Websites)  All agencies, departments, and institutions of state government shall be responsible for providing on its Internet website a link to the Internet website of any agency, other than the individual agency, department, or institution, that posts on its Internet website that agency, department, or institution's monthly state procurement card statements or monthly reports containing all or substantially all the same information contained in the monthly state procurement card statements.  The link must be to the specific webpage or section on the website of the agency where the state procurement card information for the state agency, department, or institution can be found.  The information posted may not contain the state procurement card number.  Any information that is expressly prohibited from public disclosure by federal or state law or regulation must be redacted from any posting required by this section.        117.82.      (GP: Regulations)  For the current fiscal year, if a state agency proposes a regulation that levies or increases a fee, fine, or that otherwise generates revenues, the title to the Joint Resolution which proposes the regulation must indicate that a fee, fine, or revenue source is being proposed.        117.83.      (GP: Joint Children's Committee)  For the current fiscal year, the Department of Revenue is directed to reduce the rate of interest paid on eligible refunds by one percentage point.  Of the revenue resulting from this reduction, $300,000 shall be transferred to the Senate for the Joint Citizens and Legislative Committee on Children to provide the report, research, and other operating expenses as directed in Section 63-1-50 of the 1976 Code.  Funds transferred to the University of South Carolina for the Joint Citizens and Legislative Committee on Children shall be maintained in a separate and distinct account.  A detailed report of all expenditures shall be made to the Executive Budget Office within thirty days of the close each fiscal quarter, and the Executive Budget Office shall distribute this information to the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.  The remaining revenue resulting from this reduction shall be transferred to the Department of Juvenile Justice to be used for mentoring or alternatives to incarceration programs.  Unexpended funds authorized by this provision may be retained and carried forward by the Senate or the Department of Juvenile Justice, respectively, and used for the same purposes.  The rate of reduction authorized in this provision shall be in addition to the reduction authorized in Proviso 41.2.        117.84.      (GP: Civil Conspiracy Defense Costs)  For the current fiscal year, for any claim that has not reached a judgment, if a state or local government employee or former state or local government employee ("government employee") is personally sued for civil conspiracy based in part upon a personnel or employment action or decision regarding an employee, the court must, prior to trial, make a final determination whether the action or decision giving rise to the suit was made by the government employee within the scope of their official duty.  If the court finds that the government employee was acting outside the scope of the employee's official duties, the government shall not thereafter expend any funds to pay or defend the claim.  If the court finds the government employee was acting within the scope of their official duties, the employee is immune from suit, liability, and damages with respect to the civil conspiracy claim.  The government may only expend funds to defend the claim if the determination is that the employee was acting within the scope of their official duties.  Nothing in this proviso prevents an insurance provider from defending and paying, respectively, any claims that the provider has contractually agreed to defend and pay.        117.85.      (GP: Recovery Audits)  The State Fiscal Accountability Authority shall contract with one or more firms to conduct recovery audits of payments made by all state agencies to vendors for goods and services. The audits must be designed to detect, document, and recover overpayments and erroneous payments to the vendors and to recommend improved financial and operational practices and procedures.  A state agency shall pay, from recovered monies received, the recovery audit firm responsible for obtaining for the agency a reimbursement or payment from a vendor a negotiated fee not to exceed twenty percent of the funds recovered by that firm.        Unless otherwise restricted by law, funds recovered, less the cost of recovery, shall be remitted to a special fund subject to appropriation by the General Assembly.  Agencies may recover costs that are documented to be directly related to implementation of this provision.        Recovery audits apply only to payments made more than one hundred eighty days prior to the date the audit is initiated and shall cover at least three complete fiscal years.        All information provided under a contract must be treated as confidential by the recovery audit firm.  A violation of this provision shall result in the forfeiture by the firm of all compensation under the contract and to the same sanctions and penalties that would apply to that disclosure.        Each state agency shall participate in this recovery audit program and shall cooperate and provide the recovery audit firm with all information necessary for the audit in a timely manner.  All vendors that provide goods or services to a state agency shall cooperate with the recovery audit firm in its audit.        A state agency shall expend or return to the federal government any federal money that is recovered through a recovery audit conducted under this provision.  Payments to the recovery audit firm from the federal share of recovered funds shall be solely from the federal portion as allowed by the federal agency.        In addition to performing the recovery audits, the recovery audit firm may conduct an analysis of contracts and pricing structures, as determined and directed by the Executive Director of the State Fiscal Accountability Authority or her or his designee, to identify and recommend future cost-savings and improved state agency financial operations going forward.

Each grant awarded by the department may not exceed twenty percent of the person's verifiable loss of agricultural commodities.  However, a person, including any grant made to a related person, may not receive grants aggregating more than one hundred thousand dollars.  Also, a person, including any grant made to a related person, may not receive grants that when combined with losses covered by insurance, exceed one hundred percent of the actual loss.  If a grant is made to a related person, the amount to be included in the limits set by this proviso must be the amount of the grant multiplied by the person's ownership interest in the related person.  However, a person who shares an ownership interest with another person or entity may not be refused a grant solely because the other person or related person has otherwise received the maximum grant amount, but in this case, the person's grant amount is limited by the person's ownership interest.        If the total amount of grants allowed pursuant to this proviso exceeds the monies in the fund, then each person's grant must be reduced proportionately.        To determine loss, the department:              (1)      must measure the person's cumulative total loss of all affected agricultural commodities for the year in which the flooding occurred against the person's expected production of all agricultural commodities affected by the flooding occurring in the aftermath of Hurricanes Michael and Florence;              (2)      shall use the person's applicable actual production history yield, as determined by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, to determine loss for insured agricultural commodities.  In determining loss for uninsured agricultural commodities, the department shall use the most recent year's county price and county yield, as applicable, as determined by the National Agriculture Statistics Service, United States Department of Agriculture; and              (3)      may require any documentation or proof it considers necessary to efficiently administer the grant program, including the ownership structure of each entity and the social security numbers of each owner.  Minimally, in order to verify loss, the department shall require the submission of dated, signed, and continuous records.  These records may include, but are not limited to, commercial receipts, settlement sheets, warehouse ledger sheets, pick records, load summaries, contemporaneous measurements, truck scale tickets, contemporaneous diaries, appraisals, ledgers of income, income statements of deposit slips, cash register tape, invoices for custom harvesting, u-pick records, and insurance documents.        Grant awards must be used for agricultural production expenses and losses due to the flooding which demonstrate an intent to continue the agricultural operation; however, awards may not be used to purchase new equipment.  The department shall develop guidelines and procedures to ensure that funds are expended in the manner outlined in grant applications, and may require any documentation it determines necessary to verify the appropriate use of grant awards including receipts.        If the department determines that a person who received a grant provided inaccurate information, then the person shall refund the entire amount of the grant.  If the department determines that a person who received a grant used the funds for ineligible expenses, then the person must refund the amount of the ineligible expenses.  If the person does not refund the appropriate amount, the Department of Revenue shall utilize the provisions of the Setoff Debt Collection Act to collect the money from the person.        The department shall coordinate the exchange of information between the USDA and the Department of Revenue to identify any person that received a Farm Aid grant for the flooding occurring in the aftermath of Hurricanes Michael and Florence and also received federal aid relief for the same disaster.  Any person that is determined to have received grant funds from both the state and federal government, must immediately repay the state grant they received.        If the department determines that a person knowingly provided false information to obtain a grant pursuant to this proviso or knowingly used funds for ineligible expenses, the person shall be subject to prosecution pursuant to Section 16-13-240.        Within forty-five days of the completion of the awarding of grants, but no later than the end of the fiscal year, the Farm Aid Advisory Board is dissolved.  Any funds remaining in the fund upon dissolution shall lapse to the general fund.        The department may accept private funds, grants, and property to be used to make financial awards from the grant program.        The Department of Agriculture must administer the grant program authorized by this proviso using existing resources and funds.        If federal funds are allocated for persons that are otherwise eligible for a grant pursuant to this proviso before the current fiscal year begins, then the provisions of this proviso are not effective and no funds may be credited to the South Carolina Farm Aid Fund.        For purposes of this proviso:              (1)      'Agricultural commodities' means wheat, cotton, flax, corn, dry beans, oats, barley, rye, tobacco, rice, peanuts, soybeans, sugar beets, sugar cane, tomatoes, grain sorghum, sunflowers, raisins, oranges, sweet corn, dry peas, freezing and canning peas, forage, apples, grapes, potatoes, industrial hemp, timber and forests, nursery crops, citrus, and other fruits and vegetables, nuts, tame hay, native grass, aquacultural species including, but not limited to, any species of finfish, mollusk, crustacean, or other aquatic invertebrate, amphibian, reptile, or aquatic plant propagated or reared in a controlled or selected environment, excluding stored grain;              (2)      'Person' means any individual, trust, estate, partnership, receiver, association, company, limited liability company, corporation, or other entity or group;              (3)      'Related person' means any person, joint venture, or entity that has a direct or indirect ownership interest of a person or legal entity; and              (4)      'Department' means the Department of Agriculture.        118.16.
