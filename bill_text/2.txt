A BILL

TO BE ENTITLED

4

AN ACT

5
6

Relating to public education; to prohibit the

7

teaching of certain concepts regarding race or sex; to

8

prohibit the classifying of students based on race; to

9

prohibit the introduction of certain courses or units of

10

study; and to provide penalties.

11

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA:

12

Section 1. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature

13

that administrators, faculty members, other employees, and

14

students at public K-12 schools and public two-year and

15

four-year institutions of higher education respect the dignity

16

of others, acknowledge the right of others to express

17

differing opinions, and foster and defend intellectual

18

honesty, freedom of inquiry and instruction, and freedom of

19

speech and association.

20

(b) The Legislature finds that tenets outlined in

21

subsection (c), often found in critical race theory, undermine

22

the objectives outlined in subsection (a) and exacerbate and

23

inflame divisions on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity,

24

religion, color, national origin, or other criteria in ways

25

contrary to the unity of the nation and the well-being of this

26

state and its residents.

the following tenets:

(1) That any sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color,

(2) That any individual should be adversely treated

10

on the basis of their sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color,

11

or national origin.

12

13

ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin, is inherently

responsible for any action committed in the past by any other

member of the same sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or

16

national origin.

may distinguish or classify a student based on race or color.

21

institution of higher education shall use or introduce a

course of instruction or unit of study directing or otherwise

compelling any student to personally affirm, adopt, or adhere

24

to any of the tenets identified in subsection (c).

25

(f) A public K-12 school or a public institution of

26
