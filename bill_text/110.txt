1. That the Code of Virginia is amended by adding a section    numbered 22.1-208.03 as follows:

§22.1-208.03. Curricula    and instruction including inherently divisive concepts    prohibited.

A. As used in this section, 
 "inherently divisive concepts" means advancing any ideas in 
 violation of Title IV and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as 
 amended, including the following concepts: (i) one 
 race, sex, or faith is inherently 
 superior to another race, sex, or faith; 
 (ii) an individual, by virtue of his or her race, sex, or faith, 
 is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or 
 subconsciously; (iii) an individual should be discriminated against or receive 
 adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race, sex, or faith; 
 (iv) members of one race, sex, or faith 
 cannot and should not attempt to treat others as individuals without respect to 
 race, sex, or faith; (v) an 
 individual's moral character is inherently determined by his or her race, sex, or faith; 
 (vi) an individual, by virtue of his or her race, sex, or faith, 
 bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the 
 same race, sex, or faith; and (vii) 
 meritocracy or traits, such as a hard work ethic, are racist or sexist or were 
 created by a particular race to oppress another race.

B. Each public elementary 
 or secondary school principal shall ensure that no 
 curriculum utilized 
 or instruction delivered in the school includes inherently divisive concepts, 
 regardless of whether such curriculum or instruction is provided by a school 
 board employee or any other individual or entity.
