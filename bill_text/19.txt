33-138. DIGNITY AND NONDISCRIMINATION IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. (1) It is
the intent of the legislature that administrators, faculty members, other
employees, and students at public schools, including public charter schools
and institutions of higher education, respect the dignity of others, acknowledge the right of others to express differing opinions, and foster and
defend intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and belief, and freedom of
speech and association.
(2) The Idaho legislature finds that tenets of sectarianism, such as
"critical race theory," undermine the objectives outlined in subsection (1)
of this section and exacerbate and inflame divisions on the basis of sex,
race, ethnicity, religion, color, national origin, or other criteria in ways
contrary to the unity of the nation and the well-being of the state of Idaho
and its citizens.
(3) In accordance with sections 5 and 6, article IX of the constitution
of the state of Idaho, and section 67-5909(7), Idaho Code:
(a) The following tenets of sectarianism may not be advocated for or endorsed in any public institution of higher education, any school district, or any public school, including a public charter school:
(i) That any sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national
origin is inherently superior or inferior;
(ii) That individuals should be adversely treated on the basis of
their sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin;
or
(iii) That individuals, by virtue of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin, are inherently responsible for
actions committed in the past by other members of the same sex,
race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin;
(b) Sectarian tenets shall not be taught in public schools;
