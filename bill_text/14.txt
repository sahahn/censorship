BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:

21

23

SECTION 1.

Arkansas Code Title 6, Chapter 16, is amended to add an

additional subchapter to read as follows:

24

Subchapter 16 — Arkansas Ethnic and Racial Equality Act

25
26

6-16-1601.

and Racial Equality Act".

31

The General Assembly finds that:

32

(1)

Legislative findings.
Our common faith traditions teach that members of all races

33

and ethnicities are made in the image of their creator and are of common

34

origin, source, and blood, and that we should love our neighbors as

35

ourselves;

36

(2)

*TNL424*

Our government does not exist for a particular race or

class, but to protect the God-given rights of all persons equally, and in the

2

words of President John F. Kennedy, “[T]he rights of man come not from the

3

generosity of the state but from the hand of God”;

4
5

(3)

Our State and Nation are founded upon the concept of

(4)

The Declaration of Independence states, “We hold these

equality;

6
7

truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are

8

endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these

9

are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness”;

10

(5)

It joins in unity to make the dream of Reverend Dr. Martin

11

Luther King, Jr. come true, who said, "I have a dream that my four little

12

children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the

13

color of their skin, but by the content of their character.

14

today!"; and

15

(6)

I have a dream

It agrees with the words of President Barack Obama when he

16

said, “[L]et's remember we are all part of one American family.

We are

17

united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law,

18

basic respect for public order, and the right of peaceful protest", and to

19

that end, our public education system should unite our common values,

20

strengthen our belief in equality under the law, promote basic respect for

21

public order, and provide a venue for robust debate, civil discourse, and

22

respect for opposing points of view in a peaceful manner.
