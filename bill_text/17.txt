LC 49 0646
SECTION 1.

(a) The General Assembly recognizes:

18

(1) The First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section I,

19

Paragraph V of the Georgia Constitution protect freedom of speech by prohibiting laws

20

abridging, curtailing, or restraining free speech;

21

(2) The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section I,

22

Paragraph II of the Georgia Constitution provide that no person shall be denied the equal

23

protection of the laws; and

24

(3) No provision in the United States Constitution or the Georgia Constitution enables

25

either the United States government or the government of this state to compel persons to

26

affirm, adopt, adhere to, profess, or promote specific beliefs.

27

(b) The General Assembly finds:

28

(1) Slavery, racial discrimination under the law, and racism in general are so inconsistent

29

with the founding principles of the United States that Americans fought a civil war to

30

eliminate the first, waged long-standing political campaigns to eradicate the second, and

31

rendered the third unacceptable in the court of public opinion, all of which dispels the idea

32

that the United States and its institutions are systemically racist and confutes the notion that

33

slavery, racial discrimination under the law, and racism should be at the center of public

34

elementary, secondary, and postsecondary educational institutions;

35

(2) Democratic societies built on the ideals of individual freedom and the self-driven

36

pursuit of prosperity with a dedication to equal opportunity for all will thrive in perpetuity,

37

while societies built on the false promises of equity and equal outcomes for all have

38

consistently ended in failed states; and

39

(3) Americans should be allowed, in the words of civil rights activist Robert Woodson, "an

40

aspirational and inspirational take on America's history, debunking the misguided argument

41

that the present-day problems of black Americans are caused by the injustices of past

42

failures, such as slavery."

personnel of the public elementary and secondary schools of this state maintain policies in

47

manner funds from the state.
