2021 - 2022  LEGISLATURE

2021 Senate BILL 410

June 10, 2021 - Introduced by Senators Jacque,  Nass and Wanggaard, cosponsored by Representatives Magnafici, Ramthun, Allen, Behnke, Cabral-Guevara, Gundrum, Horlacher, Kuglitsch, Rozar, Sortwell, Wichgers and Thiesfeldt. Referred to Committee on Government Operations, Legal Review and Consumer Protection.

SB410,1,3 1An Act to create 66.05105 and 230.49 of the statutes; relating to: anti-racism 2and anti-sexism training for employees of state government and local 3government.

Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau

This bill prohibits sex and race stereotyping in training provided to employees of local and state government.

Under the bill, a political subdivision or state agency is prohibited from requiring an employee to attend a training that teaches, advocates, acts upon, or promotes race or sex stereotyping.  Among the concepts that are prohibited from being taught under the bill are the following: that one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex and that an individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, bears responsibility for acts committed in the past by other individuals of the same race or sex.  Political subdivisions and state agencies are required, with some exceptions, to post on the Internet site of the subdivision or agency all training materials that are not required to be kept confidential.

Also under this bill, if the Department of Revenue determines that a political subdivision has violated the sex and race stereotyping in training requirements and the political subdivision fails to come into compliance within 10 days of being notified of the violation, the political subdivision's shared revenue payment for the following year is reduced by 10 percent.  However, if DOR determines that a political subdivision has later come into compliance with the requirements, DOR must pay the political subdivision the full amount of the shared revenue payment.  The bill also allows a local employee to file a complaint with DOR regarding an alleged violation of the bill, and to file a civil action seeking declaratory or injunctive relief regarding an alleged violation of the bill.  If the employee is successful in the civil action, the court must award the employee attorney fees.

Also under this bill, if the Department of Administration determines that a state agency has violated the sex and race stereotyping in training requirements and the agency fails to come into compliance within 10 days of being notified of the violation, DOA must withhold 10 percent of the funding for all positions in the agency for the following year.  However, if DOA determines that an agency has later come into compliance with the requirements, DOA must release the full funding for the positions.  The bill also allows a state employee to file a complaint with DOA regarding an alleged violation of the bill and to file a civil action seeking declaratory or injunctive relief regarding an alleged violation of the bill.  If the employee is successful in the civil action, the court must award the employee attorney fees.

For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.
