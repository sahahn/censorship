§ 24.2-653.01. Provisional ballots; electoral boards to make  determination as to validity.

A. The electoral board shall meet on the day following the  election and determine whether each person having submitted a provisional vote  pursuant to § 24.2-653 was entitled to do so as a qualified voter in the  precinct in which he offered the provisional vote. In the case of persons  voting provisionally pursuant to § 24.2-653.3, the electoral board shall determine  of which district the person is a qualified voter. At the meeting, the voter  may request an extension of the determination of the provisional vote in order  to provide information to prove that the voter is entitled to vote in the  precinct pursuant to § 24.2-401. The electoral board shall have the authority  to grant such extensions that it deems reasonable to determine the status of a  provisional vote.

If the board is unable to determine the validity of all the
provisional ballots offered in the election, or has granted any voter who has
offered a provisional ballot an extension, the meeting shall stand adjourned,
not to exceed seven calendar days from the date of the election, until the
board has determined the validity of all provisional ballots offered in the
election.

B. The electoral board shall permit one authorized
representative of each political party or independent candidate in a general or
special election or one authorized representative of each candidate in a
primary election to remain in the room in which the determination is being made
as an observer so long as he does not participate in the proceedings and does
not impede the orderly conduct of the determination. Each authorized
representative shall be a qualified voter of any jurisdiction of the
Commonwealth. Each representative, who is not himself a candidate or party
chairman, shall present to the electoral board a written statement designating
him to be a representative of the party or candidate and signed by the county
or city chairman of his political party, the independent candidate, or the
primary candidate, as appropriate. If the county or city chairman is
unavailable to sign such a written designation, such a designation may be made
by the state or district chairman of the political party. However, no written
designation made by a state or district chairman shall take precedence over a
written designation made by the county or city chairman. Such statement,
bearing the chairman's or candidate's original signature, may be photocopied and
such photocopy shall be as valid as if the copy had been signed.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the Virginia Freedom of  Information Act (§ 2.2-3700 et seq.), attendance at meetings of the electoral  board to determine the validity of provisional ballots shall be permitted only  for the authorized representatives provided for in this subsection, for the  persons whose provisional votes are being considered and their representative  or legal counsel, and for appropriate staff and legal counsel for the electoral  board.

C. If the electoral board determines that such person was not  entitled to vote as a qualified voter in the precinct or district in which he  offered the provisional vote, is unable to determine his right to vote, or has  not been provided one of the forms of identification specified in subsection B  of § 24.2-643, the envelope containing his ballot shall  not be opened and his vote shall not be counted. The general registrar shall  notify in writing pursuant to § 24.2-114 those persons found not properly  registered or whose provisional vote was not counted.

registered voter he claims to be

If the electoral board determines that such person was  entitled to vote, the name of the voter shall be entered in a provisional votes  pollbook and marked as having voted, the envelope shall be opened, and the  ballot shall be placed in a ballot container without any inspection further  than that provided for in § 24.2-646.

D. On completion of its determination, the electoral board  shall proceed to count such ballots and certify the results of its count. Its  certified results shall be added to those found pursuant to § 24.2-671. No  adjustment shall be made to the statement of results for the precinct in which  the person offered to vote. However, any voter who cast a provisional ballot  and is determined by the electoral board to have been entitled to vote shall  have his name included on the list of persons who voted that is submitted to  the Department of Elections pursuant to § 24.2-406.

E. The certification of the results of the count together with  all ballots and envelopes, whether open or unopened, and other related material  shall be delivered by the electoral board to the clerk of the circuit court and  retained by him as provided for in §§ 24.2-668 and 24.2-669.

8) a) $6,000,000 to the Department of Behavioral Health and
Developmental Services (720) to enter into an emergency contract to expand its
contract with the alternative transportation provider with whom the department
has entered into a contract to provide alternative transportation for adults
and children under a temporary detention order to ensure adequate staffing to
allow the alternative transportation provider to take custody and provide
transportation of all persons for whom alternative transportation is ordered.

b) $12,000,000 to the Department of Criminal Justice Services
(140), in collaboration with the Compensation Board (127), for distribution to
local law-enforcement agencies to allow local law-enforcement agencies to enter
into contracts with qualified retired law-enforcement officers to allow such
qualified retired law-enforcement officers to take custody and provide
transportation of adults and children who are subject to a temporary detention
order and for whom alternative transportation is not ordered. A qualified
retired law-enforcement officer is a law-enforcement officer who retired in
good standing from a law-enforcement agency in the Commonwealth and who has
completed a training program on the safe provision of custody and
transportation of adults and children who are subject to a temporary detention
order and is able and willing to safely provide transportation of a person who
is subject to a temporary detention order. Such contracts shall limit the
number of hours for which a qualified retired law-enforcement officer may be
compensated to no more than 29 hours per week on average over a 12-month
period.  The department shall take into consideration in the distribution
of funding to local law-enforcement agencies the size of the local
law-enforcement agency, the burden placed on such agency by transportation of
individuals subject to a temporary detention, and other relevant factors to
ensure the agencies with the greatest financial need receive priority funding.

Explanation: This amendment provides $18.0 million from  federal American Rescue Plan Act funds to expand the existing contract to  ensure adequate staffing to allow the alternative transportation provider to  take custody and provide transportation of all persons for whom alternative  transportation is ordered under a Temporary Detention Order.  In addition,  funding is provided to support local law-enforcement agencies to allow local  law-enforcement agencies to enter into contracts with qualified retired  law-enforcement officers to allow such qualified retired law-enforcement  officers to take custody and provide transportation of adults and children who  are subject to a temporary detention order and for whom alternative  transportation is not ordered.

27. That §§ 60.2-612 and 60.2-618 of the Code of Virginia are  amended and reenacted as follows:

§ 60.2-612. Benefit eligibility conditions.

An unemployed individual shall be eligible to receive benefits
for any week only if the Commission finds that:

1. He has, in the highest two quarters of earnings within his  base period, been paid wages in employment for employers that are equal to not  less than the lowest amount appearing in Column A of the "Benefit  Table" appearing in § 60.2-602 on the line which extends through Division  C and on which in Column B of the "Benefit Table" appears his weekly  benefit amount. Such wages shall be earned in not less than two quarters.

2. a. His total or partial unemployment is not due to a labor
dispute in active progress or to shutdown or start-up operations caused by such
dispute which exists (i) at the factory, establishment, or other premises,
including a vessel, at which he is or was last employed, or (ii) at a factory,
establishment or other premises, including a vessel, either within or without
this Commonwealth, which (a) is owned or operated by the same employing unit
which owns or operates the premises at which he is or was last employed and (b)
supplies materials or services necessary to the continued and usual operation
of the premises at which he is or was last employed. This subdivision shall not
apply if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commission that:

(1) He is not participating in or financing or directly
interested in the labor dispute; and

(2) He does not belong to a grade or class of workers of
which, immediately before the commencement of the labor dispute, there were
members employed at the premises, including a vessel, at which the labor
dispute occurs, any of whom are participating in or financing or directly
interested in the dispute.

b. If separate branches of work which are commonly conducted
as separate businesses at separate premises are conducted in separate
departments of the same premises, each such department shall, for the purposes
of this subdivision, be deemed to be a separate factory, establishment or other
premises. Membership in a union, or the payment of regular dues to a bona fide
labor organization, however, shall not alone constitute financing a labor
dispute.

3. He is not receiving, has not received or is not seeking
unemployment benefits under an unemployment compensation law of any other state
or of the United States; however, if the appropriate agency of such other state
or of the United States finally determines that he is not entitled to such
unemployment benefits, this subdivision shall not apply.

4. He is not on a bona fide paid vacation. If an individual is  paid vacation pay for any week in an amount less than the individual’s weekly  benefit amount, his eligibility for benefits shall be computed under the  provisions of § 60.2-603.

5. He has registered for work and thereafter has continued to
report at an employment office in accordance with such regulations as the
Commission may prescribe. The Commission may, by regulation, waive or alter
either or both of the requirements of this subdivision for certain types of
cases when it finds that compliance with such requirements would be oppressive,
or would be inconsistent with the purposes of this title.

6. He has made a claim for benefits in accordance with
regulations the Commission may prescribe.

7. a. He is able to work, is available for work, and is  actively seeking and unable to obtain suitable work. Every claimant who is  totally unemployed shall report to the Commission (i) the names of  employers contacted each week in his effort to obtain work and (ii) whether  any potential employer has requested an interview with the individual, and if  an interview has been requested, information on the individual’s satisfaction  of the provisions of subdivision d. This information may be subject to employer  verification by the Commission through a program designed for that purpose. The  Commission may determine that registration by a claimant with the Virginia  State Job Service may constitute a valid employer contact and satisfy the  search for work requirement of this subsection in labor market areas where job  opportunities are limited. The Commission may determine that an individual,  whose usual and customary means of soliciting work in his occupation is through  contact with a single hiring hall which makes contacts with multiple employers  on behalf of the claimant, meets the requirement that he be actively seeking  and unable to obtain suitable work by contacting that hiring hall alone. In  areas of high unemployment, as determined by the Commission, the Commission has  the authority to adjust the requirement that he be actively seeking and unable  to obtain suitable work.

b. An individual who leaves the normal labor market area of
the individual for the major portion of any week is presumed to be unavailable
for work within the meaning of this section. This presumption may be overcome
if the individual establishes to the satisfaction of the Commission that the
individual has conducted a bona fide search for work and has been reasonably
accessible to suitable work in the labor market area in which the individual
spent the major portion of the week to which the presumption applies.

c. An individual whose type of work is such that it is
performed by individuals working two or more shifts in a 24-hour period shall
not be deemed unavailable for work if the individual is currently enrolled in
one or more classes of education related to employment or is continuing in a
certificate or degree program at an institution of higher education, provided
that the enrollment would only limit the individual’s availability for one
shift and the individual is otherwise available to work any of the other
shifts.

d. After receiving an interview request by an employer
offering suitable work, he has (i) responded to the interview request within 48
hours using the contact information provided by the employer, (ii) scheduled an
interview with the employer to take place within seven days or a period outside
of seven days if mutually agreed upon by both parties, (iii) appeared for the
scheduled interview, and (iv) attended any reemployment activity associated
with the interview request if required by the employer in its normal course of
recruitment, including drug testing, skills assessments, or other similar
reemployment activities.

8. He has given notice of resignation to his employer and the  employer subsequently made the termination of employment effective prior to the  date of termination as given in the notice, but in no case shall unemployment  compensation benefits awarded under this subdivision exceed two weeks,  provided that the claimant could not establish good cause for leaving  work pursuant to § 60.2-618 and was not discharged for misconduct as provided  in § 60.2-618.

;

,

9. Beginning January 6, 1991, he has served a waiting period of  one week during which he was eligible for benefits under this section in all  other respects and has not received benefits, except that only one waiting week  shall be required of such individual within any benefit year. For claims filed  effective November 28, 1999, and after, this requirement shall be waived for  any individual whose unemployment was caused by his employer terminating  operations, closing its business or declaring bankruptcy without paying the  final wages earned as required by § 40.1-29.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, if an employer who  terminates operations, closes its business or declares bankruptcy pays an  individual his final wages after the period of time prescribed by § 40.1-29, such payment shall not be offset against the  benefits the individual was otherwise entitled to receive and shall not, under  any circumstances, cause such individual to be declared overpaid benefits.

10. He is not imprisoned or confined in jail.

11. He participates in reemployment services, such as job
search assistance services, if he has been determined to be likely to exhaust
regular benefits and need reemployment services pursuant to a profiling system
established by the Commission, unless the Commission determines that (i) such
claimant has completed such services or (ii) there is good cause for such
claimant’s failure to participate in such services.

§ 60.2-618. Disqualification for benefits.

An individual shall be disqualified for benefits upon
separation from the last employing unit for whom he has worked 30 days or 240
hours or from any subsequent employing unit:

1. For any week benefits are claimed until he has performed
services for an employer (i) during 30 days, whether or not such days are
consecutive, or (ii) for 240 hours, and subsequently becomes totally or
partially separated from such employment, if the Commission finds such
individual is unemployed because he left work voluntarily without good cause.

If (a) at the time of commencing employment with such
employing unit an individual is enrolled in an accredited academic program of
study provided by an institution of higher education for students that have
been awarded a baccalaureate degree, which academic program culminates in the awarding
of a master’s, doctoral, or professional degree; (b) the individual's
employment with such employing unit commenced and ended during the period
between spring and fall semesters of the academic program in which the
individual is enrolled; and (c) the individual returned to such academic
program following his separation from such employing unit, there shall be a
rebuttable presumption that the individual left work voluntarily.

As used in this chapter, “good cause” shall not include (1)
voluntarily leaving work with an employer to become self-employed or (2)
voluntarily leaving work with an employer to accompany or to join his or her
spouse in a new locality, except where an individual leaves employment to
accompany a spouse to the location of the spouse’s new duty assignment if (A)
the spouse is on active duty in the military or naval services of the United
States; (B) the spouse’s relocation to a new military-related assignment is
pursuant to a permanent change of station order; (C) the location of the spouse’s
new duty assignment is not readily accessible from the individual’s place of
employment; and (D) except for members of the Virginia National Guard
relocating to a new assignment within the Commonwealth, the spouse’s new duty
assignment is located in a state that, pursuant to statute, does not deem a
person accompanying a military spouse as a person leaving work voluntarily
without good cause. An individual shall not be deemed to have voluntarily left
work solely because the separation was in accordance with a seniority-based
policy.

2. a. For any week benefits are claimed until he has performed
services for an employer (i) during 30 days, whether or not such days are
consecutive, or (ii) for 240 hours, and subsequently becomes totally or
partially separated from such employment, if the Commission finds such
individual is unemployed because he has been discharged for misconduct
connected with his work.

b. For the purpose of this subdivision, “misconduct” includes,
but shall not be limited to:

(1) An employee’s confirmed positive test for a nonprescribed  controlled substance, identified as such in Chapter 34 (§ 54.1-3400 et seq.) of  Title 54.1, where such test was conducted at the direction of his employer in  conjunction with the employer’s administration and enforcement of a known  workplace drug policy. Such test shall have been performed, and a sample  collected, in accordance with scientifically recognized standards by a  laboratory accredited by the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services, the College of American Pathology, or the  American Association for Clinical Chemistry, or the equivalent, or shall have  been a U.S. Department of Transportation-qualified  drug screen conducted in accordance with the employer’s bona fide drug policy.  The Commission may consider evidence of mitigating circumstances in determining  whether misconduct occurred.

or

(2) An employee’s intentionally false or misleading statement
of a material nature concerning past criminal convictions made in a written job
application furnished to the employer, where such statement was a basis for the
termination and the employer terminated the employee promptly upon the
discovery thereof. The Commission may consider evidence of mitigating
circumstances in determining whether misconduct occurred.

(3) A willful and deliberate violation of a standard or  regulation of the Commonwealth by an employee of an employer licensed  or certified by the Commonwealth, which violation would cause the employer to  be sanctioned or have its license or certification suspended by the  Commonwealth. The Commission may consider evidence of mitigating circumstances  in determining whether misconduct occurred.

,

(4) Chronic absenteeism or tardiness in deliberate violation
of a known policy of the employer or one or more unapproved absences following
a written reprimand or warning relating to more than one unapproved absence.
The Commission may consider evidence of mitigating circumstances in determining
whether misconduct occurred.

(5) An employee’s loss of or failure to renew a license or
certification that is a requisite of the position held by the employee,
provided the employer is not at fault for the employee’s loss of or failure to
renew the license or certification. The Commission may consider evidence of
mitigating circumstances in determining whether misconduct occurred.

3. a. If it is determined by the Commission that such  individual has failed, without good cause, to apply for  available, suitable work when so directed by the employment office or the  Commission, to satisfy the requirements of subdivision 7 d of § 60.2-612,  or to accept suitable work when offered him. The disqualification shall  commence with the week in which such failure occurred and shall  continue for the period of unemployment next ensuing until he has performed  services for an employer (i) during 30 days, whether or not such days are  consecutive, or (ii) for 240 hours, and subsequently becomes totally or  partially separated from such employment.

,

b. In determining whether or not any work is suitable for an
individual, the Commission shall consider the degree of risk involved to his
health, safety and morals, his physical fitness and prior training, his
experience, his length of unemployment and the accessibility of the available
work from his residence.

c. No work shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall not be
denied under this title to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to
accept new work under any of the following conditions:

(1) If the position offered is vacant due directly to a
strike, lockout, or other labor dispute;

(2) If the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work
offered are substantially less favorable to the individual than those
prevailing for similar work in the locality; or

(3) If as a condition of being employed the individual would
be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining
any bona fide labor organization.

d. No individual shall be qualified for benefits during any  week that such individual, in connection with an offer of suitable work, has a  confirmed positive test for a nonprescribed controlled substance, identified as  such in Chapter 34 (§ 54.1-3400 et seq.) of Title 54.1, if the test is required  as a condition of employment and (i) performed, and a sample is collected, in  accordance with scientifically recognized standards by a laboratory accredited  by the U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services, the College of American Pathology, or the American  Association for Clinical Chemistry, or the equivalent, or (ii) a U.S. Department of Transportation-qualified drug screen  conducted in accordance with the employer's bona fide drug policy. The  disqualification shall commence with the week in which such a test was  conducted and shall continue for the period of unemployment next  ensuing until he has performed services for an employer (a)  during 30 days, whether or not such days are consecutive, or (b)  for 240 hours, and subsequently becomes totally or partially separated from  such employment.

4. For 52 weeks, beginning with the date of the determination  or decision, if the Commission finds that such individual, within 36 calendar  months immediately preceding such determination or decision, has made a false  statement or representation knowing it to be false, or has knowingly failed to  disclose a material fact, to obtain or increase any benefit or payment under  this title, the unemployment compensation of any other state, or any other  program of the federal government which is administered in any way under this  title, either for himself or any other person. Overpayments that have been  fraudulently obtained and any penalty assessed against the individual pursuant  to § 60.2-636 shall be recoverable as provided in § 60.2-633.

5. If such separation arose as a result of an unlawful act
which resulted in a conviction and after his release from prison or jail until
he has performed services for an employer for (i) 30 days, whether or not such
days are consecutive, or (ii) 240 hours, and subsequently becomes totally or
partially separated from such employment.

6. If such separation arose as a condition of the individual’s  parole or release from a custodial or penal institution and such individual was  participating in the community corrections alternative program pursuant to §  19.2-316.4.

28. That, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the  Virginia Employment Commission (VEC) shall not administer payments under the  Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) program authorized by § 2104  of the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, P.L.  116-136 (the CARES Act), as amended, or the Mixed Earners Unemployment  Compensation (MEUC) program authorized by § 2104 of the CARES Act, as amended,  after the effective date of this enactment. Nothing in this act shall prevent  the VEC from administering payments under the FPUC and MEUC programs paid or  accrued before the effective date of this enactment, and such payments may be  paid, adjudicated, collected, or otherwise administered after the effective  date of this enactment.

Explanation: The amendment prohibits the Virginia  Employment Commission from administering payments under the Federal Pandemic  Unemployment Compensation program or the Mixed Earners Unemployment  Compensation program, as each is authorized by the federal Coronavirus Aid,  Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the CARES Act). The amendment also  requires an individual, in order to be eligible to receive unemployment  compensation benefits, after receiving an interview request by an employer  offering suitable work, to (i) respond to the interview request within 48 hours  using the contact information provided by the employer, (ii) schedule an  interview with the employer to take place within seven days or a period outside  of seven days if mutually agreed upon by both parties, (iii) appear for the  scheduled interview, and (iv) attend any reemployment activity associated with  the interview request if required by the employer in its normal course of  recruitment, including drug testing, skills assessments, or other similar  reemployment activities.
