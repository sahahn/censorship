261H.2 Policy adoption Public institutions of higher
education —— duties.
1. The state board of regents and the board of directors of
each community college shall adopt a policy that includes all
of the following statements:
1. a. That the primary function of an institution of higher
education is the discovery, improvement, transmission, and
dissemination of knowledge by means of research, teaching,
discussion, and debate. This statement shall provide that, to
fulfill this function, the institution must strive to ensure
the fullest degree of intellectual freedom and free expression
allowed under the first amendment to the Constitution of the
United States.
2. a. b. (1) That it is not the proper role of an
institution of higher education to shield individuals from
speech protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of
the United States, which may include ideas and opinions the
individual finds unwelcome, disagreeable, or even offensive.
b. (2) That it is the proper role of an institution of
higher education to encourage diversity of thoughts, ideas,
and opinions and to encourage, within the bounds of the
first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the
peaceful, respectful, and safe exercise of first amendment
rights.
3. c. That students and faculty have the freedom to
discuss any problem that presents itself, assemble, and engage
in spontaneous expressive activity on campus, within the
bounds of established principles of the first amendment to the
Constitution of the United States, and subject to reasonable
time, place, and manner restrictions that are consistent with
established first amendment principles.
4. d. That the outdoor areas of campus of an institution
of higher education are public forums, open on the same terms

to any invited speaker subject to reasonable time, place,
and manner restrictions that are consistent with established
principles of the first amendment to the Constitution of the

consistent with this chapter.
3. a. Each public institution of higher education shall
protect the first amendment rights of the institution’s
students, staff, and faculty and shall establish and publicize

institution, and such discipline may include termination
depending on the totality of the facts. If the faculty member

EXPLANATION
The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
the explanation’s substance by the members of the general assembly.

This bill provides for first amendment rights training,
prohibitions, and requirements at or by school districts and
public postsecondary educational institutions.
Each public institution of higher education must develop
materials, programs, and procedures to ensure that those
persons who are responsible for discipline, instruction, or
administration of the campus community, and who have oversight
of student government organizations, or distribute activity fee
funds, understand the policies, regulations, and duties of the
institution regarding free expression on campus.
Each such public institution of higher education must
protect the first amendment rights of its students, staff, and
faculty and must establish and publicize policies that prohibit
institutional restrictions and penalties based on protected
speech. An institution shall not retaliate against a person
filing a discrimination complaint.
If it is determined that a faculty member knowingly and
intentionally restricts the protected speech or otherwise

penalizes a student, the faculty member shall be subject to
discipline by the institution. The bill establishes similar
requirements for school districts. If the faculty member or in
the case of a school district, the school employee, is licensed
by the board of educational examiners, the faculty member or
school employee, as appropriate, may be subject to disciplinary
action by the board.
If it is determined that a student government organization
knowingly and intentionally violated the first amendment
rights of a member of the campus community or is in violation
of the provisions of the bill, the institution shall suspend
the student government organization’s authority to manage and
disburse student fees for a period of two years, during which
time the student fees shall be managed and disbursed by the
institution.
Each public institution of higher education must provide
to each student and each student government organization
instruction and training on the first amendment to the
Constitution of the United States, including descriptions of
what is or is not protected under the amendment.
Each school district and each public institution of higher
learning may continue all training that fosters a workplace
that is respectful of all employees and students, but the
superintendent of the school district or the president of the
institution must ensure that any mandatory staff or student
training provided by an employee of the school district or the
institution or by a contractor hired by the school district
or the institution does not teach, advocate, act upon, or
promote divisive concepts, which the bill defines to include
that one race or sex is inherently superior to another; that
Iowa is fundamentally racist or sexist; that an individual,
by virtue of the individual’s race or sex, is inherently
racist, sexist, or oppressive; that an individual should be
discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or
partly because of his or her race or sex; that members of one

race or sex cannot and should not attempt to treat others
without respect to race or sex; that an individual’s moral
character is necessarily determined by his or her race or sex;
that an individual bears responsibility for actions committed
in the past by other members of the same race or sex; that any
individual should feel psychological distress on account of
that individual’s race or sex; and that meritocracy or traits
such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created
by a particular race to oppress another race.
The bill defines “race or sex stereotyping” as ascribing
character traits, values, moral and ethical codes, status, or
beliefs to a race or sex, or to an individual because of the
individual’s race or sex; assigning fault, blame, or bias to
a race or sex; or to members of a race or sex because of their
race or sex; or claiming that, consciously or unconsciously,
and by virtue of persons’ race or sex, members of any race are
inherently racist or are inherently inclined to oppress others,
or that members of a sex are inherently sexist or inclined to
oppress others.
Institution diversity and inclusion efforts must discourage
students of the school district or institution from
discriminating against another for any characteristic protected
under Code chapter 216 or the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Nothing in the provisions relating to training prohibitions
shall be construed to inhibit or violate the first amendment
rights of students or faculty or undermine the institution’s or
school district’s duty to protect intellectual freedom and free
expression; prevent a school district or public postsecondary
institution from promoting diversity or inclusiveness; to
prohibit discussing divisive concepts as part of a larger
course of academic instruction; to create any right or benefit,
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the state of Iowa, its departments,
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or
any other person; or to prohibit a state or federal court or

Each regents university shall make student government
organization access to and authority over any moneys disbursed
to the student government organization by the university
contingent upon the student government organization’s
compliance with the first amendment to the Constitution of the
United States and with Code chapter 261H.
If, after the exhaustion of administrative or judicial
appeals, it is determined that a student government
organization knowingly and intentionally violated the first
amendment rights of a member of the campus community or that
an action of a student government organization violated the
provisions of the bill, the institution shall suspend the
student government organization’s authority to manage and
disburse student fees for one year. During this period of
suspension, such student fees shall be managed and disbursed
by the institution.
The state board of regents must annually appoint from among
its membership a three-member nonpartisan free speech appeals
committee to receive complaints under Code section 261H.5
relating to the institutions of higher learning governed by the
state board.
Code section 280.22 provides that public school students
have the right to exercise freedom of speech, including the
right of expression in official school publications, with
exceptions for materials that are obscene, libelous, or
slanderous, or encourage students to commit unlawful acts,
violate lawful school regulations, or cause the material
and substantial disruption of the orderly operation of the
school. Prior restraint of permitted materials is prohibited.
Expression made by students in the exercise of free speech
shall not be deemed to be an expression of school policy, and a
public school is not liable for such expression.

The bill provides that a public school employee or official
shall not be dismissed, suspended, disciplined, reassigned,
transferred, subject to termination or nonrenewal of a
teaching contract or an extracurricular contract, or otherwise
retaliated against for acting to protect a student for engaging
in conduct authorized under Iowa law pertaining to freedom of
expression of public school students, or refusing to infringe
upon student conduct that is protected by such Iowa law, the
first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or
Article I, section 7, of the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
The bill modifies a requirement that journalism advisers
of students producing official school publications supervise
the production of the student staff in order to maintain the
professional standards.
The bill provides that the written publications code that
each school board is required to adopt under Code section
280.22 shall incorporate all of the provisions of that Code
section.
The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
mandate included in the bill.
