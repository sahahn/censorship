core academic curriculum in compliance with subsection (3) in each

2

of the curricular areas specified in the state board recommended

3

model core academic curriculum content standards developed under

4

subsection (2). The state board model core academic curriculum

5

content standards shall must encompass academic and cognitive

6

instruction only, and must not, in any way, include any form of

7

race or gender stereotyping or anything that could be understood as

8

implicit race or gender stereotyping. For purposes of this section,

9

the state board model core academic curriculum content standards

10

shall must not include attitudes, beliefs, or value systems that

11

are not essential in the legal, economic, and social structure of

12

our society and to the personal and social responsibility of

13

citizens of our society.

14

(2) Recommended model core academic curriculum content

15

standards shall must be developed and periodically updated by the

16

state board, shall must be in the form of knowledge and skill

17

content standards that are recommended as state standards for

18

adoption by public schools in local curriculum formulation and

19

adoption, and shall must be distributed to each school district in

20

the state. The recommended model core academic curriculum content

21

standards shall must set forth desired learning objectives in math,

22

science, reading, history, geography, economics, American

23

government, and writing for all children at each stage of schooling

24

and be based upon the "Michigan K-12 Program Standards of Quality"

25

to ensure that high academic standards, academic skills, and

26

academic subject matters are built into the instructional goals of

27

all school districts for all children. The state board shall ensure

28

that the recommended model core academic curriculum content

29

standards for history for grades 8 to 12 include learning

objectives concerning genocide, including, but not limited to, the

2

Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide. The state board also shall

3

ensure that the state assessment program and the Michigan merit

4

examination are based on the state recommended model core

5

curriculum content standards, are testing only for proficiency in

6

basic and advanced academic skills and academic subject matter, and

7

are not used to measure pupils' values or attitudes.

(3) The board of each school district, considering academic
curricular objectives defined and recommended pursuant to under
subsection (2), shall do both of the following:

11

(a) Establish a core academic curriculum for its pupils at the

12

elementary, middle, and secondary school levels. The core academic

13

curriculum shall must define academic objectives to be achieved by

14

all pupils and shall must be based upon the school district's

15

educational mission, long-range pupil goals, and pupil performance

16

objectives. The core academic curriculum may vary from the model

17

core academic curriculum content standards recommended by the state

18

board pursuant to under subsection (2). However, the core academic

19

curriculum must not, in any way, include any form of race or gender

20

stereotyping or anything that could be understood as implicit race

21

or gender stereotyping.

22

(b) After consulting with teachers and school building

23

administrators, determine the aligned instructional program for

24

delivering the core academic curriculum and identify the courses

25

and programs in which the core academic curriculum will be taught.

(4) The board may supplement the core academic curriculum by
providing instruction through additional classes and programs.

curriculum the pupils engage in shall must assure the pupils have a

required by the core academic curriculum pursuant to under

5

a consortium of 1 or more school districts and 1 or more

10

develop academic objective-oriented high standards for knowledge

11

and life skills, and a recommended core academic curriculum, for

12

special education pupils for whom it may not be realistic or

13

desirable to expect achievement of initial mastery of the state

14

board recommended model core academic content standards objectives

15

or of a high school diploma.

16

(7) The state board shall make available to all nonpublic

17

schools in this state, as a resource for their consideration, the

18

model core academic curriculum content standards developed for

19

public schools pursuant to under subsection (2) for the purpose of

20

assisting the governing body of a nonpublic school in developing

21

its core academic curriculum.

22

(8) Excluding special education pupils, pupils having a

23

learning disability, and pupils with extenuating circumstances as

satisfactorily on the fourth or seventh grade 4 or 7 state

26

assessment program reading test shall must be provided special

27

assistance reasonably expected to enable the pupil to bring his or

28

her reading skills to grade level within 12 months.
