AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS TO TEACH THE 1619 PROJECT CURRICULUM; TO PROVIDE THAT ELEMENTARY

BE IT ENACTED BY THE
LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI:

This  act shall be known and may be cited as the "Saving American History in Mississippi  Schools Act of 2020."

SECTION 1.

The  Legislature finds the following:

SECTION 2.

(a)  The true date of America's
founding is July 4, 1775, the day the Declaration of Independence was adopted by
the Second Continental Congress.

(b)  The self-evident truths
set forth by that Declaration are the fundamental principles upon which America
was founded.

(c)  An activist movement
is now gaining momentum to deny or obfuscate this history by claiming that America
was not founded on the ideals of the Declaration but rather on slavery and oppression.
 This distortion of American history is being taught to children in public school
classrooms via the New York Times' "1619 Project".

(d)  The 1619 Project is
racially divisive and revisionist account of history that threatens the integrity
of the Union by denying the true principles on which it was founded.

(e)  The State of Mississippi
has a strong interest in promoting an accurate account of the Nation's history through
public schools and forming young people into knowledgeable and patriotic citizens.

Notwithstanding  any other provision of law, no state funds shall be used by any elementary school  or secondary school to teach the 1619 Project Initiative of the New York Times.

SECTION 3.

Notwithstanding  any other provision of law, an elementary school or secondary school that teaches  the 1619 Project initiative of the New York Times in such school shall not receive  any funding for professional development.

SECTION 4.

In  the case of an elementary school or secondary school that receives state funding  and teaches the 1619 Project initiative of the New York Times, the State Department  of Education shall determine the cost associated with teaching the 1619 Project,  including in planning time and teaching time.

SECTION 5.

The  State Department of Education shall reduce funds provided to an elementary or secondary  school in an amount equal to the cost amount determined under Section 5 of this  act       If an elementary school or secondary school teaches  the 1619 Project, the State Department of Education shall reduce the school's allotment  of funds from the Mississippi Adequate Education Program by twenty-five percent  (25%) for each year that the school teaches the 1619 Project.

SECTION 6.

SECTION 7.

This act shall take effect and be in force from and after July 1, 2021.
