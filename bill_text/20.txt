33-138. DIGNITY AND NONDISCRIMINATION IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. (1) It is
the intent of the legislature that administrators, faculty members, other
employees, and students at public schools, including public charter schools
and institutions of higher education, respect the dignity of others, acknowledge the right of others to express differing opinions, and foster and
defend intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and instruction, and freedom of speech and association.
(2) The Idaho legislature finds that tenets outlined in subsection
(3)(a) of this section, often found in "critical race theory," undermine the
objectives outlined in subsection (1) of this section and exacerbate and
inflame divisions on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, national origin, or other criteria in ways contrary to the unity of the nation
and the well-being of the state of Idaho and its citizens.
(3) In accordance with section 6, article IX of the constitution of the
state of Idaho and section 67-5909, Idaho Code:
(a) No public institution of higher education, school district, or public school, including a public charter school, shall direct or otherwise compel students to personally affirm, adopt, or adhere to any of
the following tenets:
(i) That any sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national
origin is inherently superior or inferior;
(ii) That individuals should be adversely treated on the basis of
their sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin;
or
(iii) That individuals, by virtue of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin, are inherently responsible for
actions committed in the past by other members of the same sex,
race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin.

public institutions of higher education.
