(Senators Myrdal, Wanzek)
(Approved by the Delayed Bills Committee)
AN ACT to create and enact a new section to chapter 15.1-21 of the North Dakota Century Code,
relating to prohibiting the teaching of critical race theory in public schools; and to provide an
effective date.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF NORTH DAKOTA:
SECTION 1. A new section to chapter 15.1-21 of the North Dakota Century Code is created and
enacted as follows:
Curriculum - Critical race theory - Prohibited.
Each school district and public school shall ensure instruction of its curriculum is factual, objective,
and aligned to the kindergarten through grade twelve state content standards. A school district or public
school may not include instruction relating to critical race theory in any portion of the district's required
curriculum under sections 15.1-21-01 or 15.1-21-02, or any other curriculum offered by the district or
school. For purposes of this section, "critical race theory" means the theory that racism is not merely the
product of learned individual bias or prejudice, but that racism is systemically embedded in American
society and the American legal system to facilitate racial inequality. The superintendent of public
instruction may adopt rules to govern this section.
SECTION 2. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act becomes effective upon its filing with the secretary of
state.
