divisive concepts, is January 1, 2022; that this act extends the prohibition

20

against propagating divisive concepts to public schools, open-enrollment

21

public charter schools, and education service cooperatives; that the second

22

semester of the 2021-2022 school year for elementary and secondary schools

23

begins in January 2022; that the law prohibiting the propagation of divisive

24

concepts should become effective for all entities subject to the law at the

25

26

concepts in schools is harming children in the state and the propagation of

27

divisive concepts in state entities is having a negative effect on recruiting

28

staff for state agencies.
